<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>WELCOME HOME</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I do think waiting for a steamer is the
horridest, pokiest performance in the
world! You never know when they&#8217;re
coming, no matter how much they sight them
and signal them and wireless them!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Allen was not pettish, and she spoke half
laughingly, but she was wearied with her long
wait for the <i>Mauretania</i>, in which she expected
her daughter, Nan, and, incidentally, Mr.
Fairfield and Patty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There, there, my dear,&#8221; said her husband,
soothingly, &#8220;I think it will soon arrive now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so, too,&#8221; declared Kenneth Harper,
who was looking down the river through field-glasses.
&#8220;I&#8217;m just sure I see that whale of a
boat in the dim distance, and I think I see
Patty&#8217;s yellow head sticking over the bow.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you?&#8221; cried Mrs. Allen eagerly; &#8220;do
you see Nan?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not positive that I do, but we soon shall
know, for that&#8217;s surely the <i>Mauretania</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It surely was, and though the last quarter
hour of waiting seemed longer than all the rest,
at last the big ship was in front of them, and
swinging around in midstream. They could see
the Fairfields clearly now, but not being within
hearing distance, they could only express their
welcome by frantic wavings of hands, handkerchiefs,
and flags. But at last the gangplank
was put in place, and at last the Fairfields
crossed it, and then an enthusiastic and somewhat
incoherent scene of reunion followed.
</p>
<p>Beside Mr. and Mrs. Allen and Kenneth
Harper, Roger and Elise Farrington were there
to meet the home-comers, and the young people
seized on Patty as if they would never let her
go again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My! but you&#8217;ve grown!&#8221; said Kenneth,
looking at her admiringly; &#8220;I mean you&#8217;re
grown-up looking, older, you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m only a year older,&#8221; returned Patty,
laughing, &#8220;and you&#8217;re that, yourself!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, so I am. But you&#8217;ve changed somehow,&mdash;I
don&#8217;t know just how.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span></p>
<p>Honest Kenneth looked so puzzled that Elise
laughed at him and said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense, Ken, it&#8217;s her clothes. She has a
foreign effect, but it will soon wear off in New
York. I <i>am</i> glad to see you again, Patty; we
didn&#8217;t think it would be so long when we parted
in Paris last Spring.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed; and I&#8217;m glad to be home again,
though I have had a terribly good time. Now,
I suppose we must see about our luggage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Roger, &#8220;you&#8217;ll be sorry you
brought so many fine clothes when you have to
pay duty on them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, duty first, and pleasure afterward,&#8221;
said Kenneth. &#8220;Come on, Patty, I&#8217;ll help you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear,&#8221; said Mrs. Allen, &#8220;must we wait
for all this custom-house botheration? I&#8217;m so
tired of waiting.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you needn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Mr. Fairfield, kindly.
&#8220;You and Nan and Mr. Allen jump in a taxicab
and go home. I&#8217;ll keep Patty with me, and
any other of the young people who care to stay,
and we&#8217;ll settle matters here in short order.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The young people all cared to stay, and
though they had to wait some time, when at
last they did get a customs inspector he proved
to be both courteous and expeditious.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t spoil my best hat!&#8221; cried Patty,
in dismay, as he laid thoughtless hands on a befeathered
creation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That I won&#8217;t, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; was the hearty response,
and the hat was laid back in its box as
carefully as an infant in its cradle. &#8220;I have
ladies in my own family, ma&#8217;am, and I know
just how you feel about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m perfectly willing to declare all my dutiable
goods,&#8221; went on Patty, &#8220;but I do hate
to have my nice things all tumbled up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite right, ma&#8217;am, quite right,&#8221; amiably
agreed the inspector, who had fallen a victim
to Patty&#8217;s pretty face and bright smiles.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you did get through easily, Patty,&#8221;
said Elise, after it was over and the trunks despatched
by express. &#8220;When we came home,
mother was half a day fussing over customs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Patty&#8217;s winning ways as does it,&#8221; said
Kenneth. &#8220;She hypnotised that fat inspector
with a mere glance of her eye.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; said Patty, laughing; &#8220;it&#8217;s an
easy trick. They&#8217;re always nice and kind if you
jolly them a little bit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jolly me,&#8221; said Kenneth, &#8220;and see how nice
and kind I&#8217;ll be.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re kind enough as you are,&#8221; returned
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
Patty. &#8220;If you were any kinder, I&#8217;d be overwhelmed
with obligations. But how are we all
going to get into this taxicab? Five into one
won&#8217;t go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s easy,&#8221; said Roger. &#8220;I&#8217;ll perch outside
with the chauffeur.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, let me,&#8221; said Kenneth.
</p>
<p>But after a good-natured controversy, Roger
won the day, and climbed into the front seat.
Mr. Fairfield, Kenneth, and the two girls settled
themselves inside, and off they started for
the Fairfields&#8217; home in Seventy-second street.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see much change in the old town,&#8221;
remarked Patty, as they neared the Flatiron.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t, eh?&#8221; observed Kenneth. &#8220;Well,
there&#8217;s the Metropolitan tower,&mdash;I guess you&#8217;ll
say that&#8217;s pretty fine, if you have seen the Campanile
in Venice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; returned Patty. &#8220;I was too
late for the old one and too soon for the new.
But is this a Campanile, father? What <i>is</i> a
Campanile, pure and simple?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A Campanile ought always to be pure and
simple, of line,&#8221; said Mr. Fairfield; &#8220;but if you
mean what is it specifically, it&#8217;s a bell tower.
Listen, you&#8217;ll hear the quarter-hour now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, what lovely chimes!&#8221; cried Patty.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
&#8220;Let&#8217;s move, father, and take a house beneath
the shadow of a great clock.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve moved enough for a while, my child;
if I once get seated at my own fireside, I shall
stay there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How Christmassy things look,&#8221; went on
Patty, gazing out of the cab window. &#8220;It&#8217;s
only the middle of December, but the streets
are crowded and there are holly wreaths in
some of the windows.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t have to buy many Christmas presents,
will you, Patty?&#8221; said Elise. &#8220;I suppose
you brought home enough Italian trinkets to
supply all your friends.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we did,&#8221; laughed Patty. &#8220;I daresay
my friends will get tired of busts of Dante, and
models of the Forum.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t give those to me. If you have a Roman
scarf nobody else wants, I&#8217;ll thank you
kindly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Elise; I&#8217;ll remember that. And
if I haven&#8217;t, I daresay I can buy one in the New
York shops.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wicked girl! Don&#8217;t attempt any such deception
on your tried and true friend. Oh,
Patty, do you remember the day we got lost in
Paris?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></p>
<p>And then the two girls plunged into a flood of
reminiscences that lasted all the way home.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in? of course we&#8217;ll come in!&#8221; said
Roger, as he assisted them from the cab, and
Patty graciously invited him. &#8220;That&#8217;s what
we&#8217;re here for! We&#8217;re all coming in, and if
we&#8217;re heartily urged, we may stay to dinner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In reality, Mrs. Allen, who was temporarily
hostess in her daughter&#8217;s house, had invited
Kenneth and the two Farringtons to dine,
in order to make a gay home-coming for
Patty.
</p>
<p>Very cosy and attractive the house looked, as,
after more than a year&#8217;s absence, Patty once
again stepped inside. It had been closed while
Mr. and Mrs. Fairfield were away, but a few
days before their return, Mrs. Allen, Nan&#8217;s
mother, had come over from Philadelphia and
opened the house and made it cheery and livable.
A bright fire glowed in the library, flowers
were all about, and holly-wreaths hung in
the windows.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good to be home again,&#8221; said Patty, as
she sank into an easy-chair and threw aside her
furs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good to have you here,&#8221; responded
Elise. &#8220;I&#8217;ve missed you terribly.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Me, too,&#8221; said Roger, while Kenneth added,
&#8220;So say we all of us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Always a favourite, wherever she went, Patty
was specially beloved by her young friends in
New York, and so the reunion was a happy one
to all concerned.
</p>
<p>Before dinner was announced, Patty flew up
to her own room to change her travelling costume
for a pretty little house-dress.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, Elise,&#8221; she said, and soon the two
girls were cosily chatting in Patty&#8217;s dressing-room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You look so different with your hair done
up,&#8221; said Elise. &#8220;Weren&#8217;t you sorry to give up
hair-ribbons?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I was; I hate to feel grown-up. Just
think, I&#8217;ll be nineteen next May.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, May&#8217;s a long way off yet. It&#8217;s only
December now. What are you going to do on
Christmas, Patty?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Nan hasn&#8217;t planned yet. She
waited to see her mother first. But I know Mrs.
Allen will invite us to Philadelphia to spend
Christmas with her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t want to go, do you? Can&#8217;t you
spend Christmas with me, instead?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;d love to, Elise! It would be lots more
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
fun. We&#8217;ll ask father to-night. How are all
the girls?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re all well, and crazy to see you. Hilda
is making you the loveliest Christmas present
you ever saw. But, of course, I promised not
to tell you about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, don&#8217;t tell me; I&#8217;d rather be surprised.
Come on, I&#8217;m ready; let&#8217;s go down and talk to
the boys.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty had done up her pretty hair in the
prevailing fashion of the day; but though the
soft braids encircled her head, many little
golden curls escaped and made a soft outline
round her face. Her frock, of pale rose colour,
had a collarless lace yoke, and was very becoming.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can wear any colour, Patty,&#8221; declared
Elise. &#8220;Of course, blue is yours, by right,
but you&#8217;re dear in that pinky thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, sweet chub, I hoped I should be dear to
thee in any old thing,&#8221; remarked Patty, as, slipping
her arm through that of Elise, the two
girls went downstairs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha, Patty resplendent!&#8221; exclaimed Roger,
as they entered the library. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare
to be a grown-up young lady, Patty Fairfield, or
I shall cut your acquaintance.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not I! Don&#8217;t be alarmed, Roger. I am
still childlike and bland.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your cousin Ethelyn is going to make her
début next week. I have a bid to the ceremonies.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, so have I. Well, let her &#8216;come out,&#8217; if
she likes. I prefer to &#8216;stay in&#8217; for another year,
anyway.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; said Elise. &#8220;Mother says I ought
to come out next winter, but I&#8217;m not bothering
about it yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s have a good time this winter, then,&#8221;
said Kenneth, &#8220;while we&#8217;re all children. If you
girls come out next winter, you&#8217;ll be so gay with
dances and parties, I can&#8217;t play with you at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; agreed Patty. &#8220;But have you
time to play, yourself, Ken? I thought you
were fearfully busy absorbing the laws of the
United States.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I do have to hammer at that all day, and
some evenings, too. But it&#8217;s an unwritten law
that a fellow must have some fun; so I&#8217;ll take
an afternoon off now and then, to come round
and tease you girls.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then dinner was announced and, following
their elders, the young people went out to the
dining-room.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, how pretty!&#8221; cried Patty, as she saw
the table, for the decoration, though simple, was
most effective.
</p>
<p>Along the centre of the white cloth, lay a long
bed of holly leaves, on which the word &#8220;Welcome&#8221;
was outlined in holly berries.
</p>
<p>There were no other flowers, and the glossy
green and vivid scarlet made a charming centrepiece,
surrounded, as it was, by dainty silver,
glass, and china.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good to be here once more,&#8221; said Nan,
as she took her place at the head of her own
table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Right you are,&#8221; said Mr. Fairfield, as he
sat opposite her. &#8220;Mother Allen, it was kind
of you to arrange this hearty Welcome Home
for us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t half express my joy at having you
here again,&#8221; said Mrs. Allen, as she looked affectionately
at her daughter.
</p>
<p>Then the conversation turned upon Christmas
and Christmas plans.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must have Nan with me at Christmas,&#8221;
said Mrs. Allen. &#8220;And I shall count on Fred,
also, of course. Patty, dear, I want you, too, if
you care to come; but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mrs. Allen,&#8221; broke in Elise, &#8220;divide the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
family with me, won&#8217;t you? If you have Mr.
and Mrs. Fairfield, won&#8217;t you let me take
Patty?&#8221;
</p>
<p>As Elise had hinted this to Mrs. Allen while
they were at the steamer dock waiting for Patty,
the good lady was not greatly surprised. And
she knew that Patty would prefer to be in New
York with her young friends, rather than in
Philadelphia.
</p>
<p>So it was settled that Patty should spend
Christmas with Elise, much to the joy of both
girls, and also to the satisfaction of the two
boys.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have a gay old time,&#8221; said Roger.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll have a tree and a dance and a boar&#8217;s
head,&mdash;whatever that thing is,&mdash;I never did
know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know either,&#8221; confessed Patty; &#8220;but
we&#8217;ll find out. For we must have all the modern
improvements.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t call a boar&#8217;s head a modern improvement,&#8221;
said Mr. Fairfield, smiling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But ours will be,&#8221; said saucy Patty, &#8220;for it
will be such an improvement on the sort they
used to have. And we&#8217;ll have carols and
waits&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are waits?&#8221; said Elise.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why, waits,&#8221; said Patty, &#8220;don&#8217;t you know
what waits are? Why, they&#8217;re just <i>waits</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said Elise, &#8220;<i>now</i> I understand <i>perfectly!</i>
You explain things so clearly, Patty!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, doesn&#8217;t she!&#8221; agreed Kenneth. &#8220;Never
mind, Elise, I&#8217;ll be a wait and show you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do,&#8221; said Elise, &#8220;I&#8217;d much rather see than
be one. Just think, Patty, Christmas is only ten
days off! Can you be ready?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said Patty, smiling. &#8220;Why, I
could get ready for two Christmases in ten
days.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonderful girl!&#8221; commented Roger. &#8220;I
thought ladies were always behind time with
their Christmas preparations. I thought they
always said, &#8216;It doesn&#8217;t seem <i>possible</i> Christmas
is so near!&#8217; and things like that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t half my presents ready,&#8221; said Kenneth,
in an exaggerated feminine voice. &#8220;I
haven&#8217;t finished that pink pincushion for Sadie,
nor the blue bedroom slippers for Bella.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Roger took the cue.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor I,&#8221; he said, also mimicking a fussy,
womanish manner. &#8220;But I never get into the
spirit of the thing until near Christmas Day.
Then I run round and try to do everything at
once.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you tie up your presents in tissue paper
and holly-ribbon?&#8221; asked Kenneth, turning to
Roger as if in earnest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; and I stick on those foolish little
seals, and holly tags. Anything to make it fussy
and fluttery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gracious,&#8221; said Patty, &#8220;that reminds me. I
suppose I must get that holly ribbon and tissue
paper flummery. I forgot all about it. What
do they use this year, Elise? White tissue
paper?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, red. It&#8217;s so nice and cheery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Roger. &#8220;Most Christmas presents
need a cheery paper. It counteracts the depressing
effect of an unwelcome gift.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t pay any attention to him,&#8221; said Elise,
&#8220;he&#8217;s putting on airs. He thinks it&#8217;s funny to
talk like that, but you just ought to see him on
Christmas! He simply adores his presents, and
fairly gloats over every one!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure I do!&#8221; said Roger, heartily. &#8220;But
when you get a purple necktie, or a hand-crocheted
watch-chain, it&#8217;s nice to have a cheery red
paper round it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I have a lovely present for you,&#8221; said
Patty, &#8220;but I shall take the precaution of wrapping
it in red paper.&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>AN ADVANCE CHRISTMAS GIFT</h3>
</div>

<p>The ten days before Christmas flew by
like Bandersnatches. Patty had a long
list of friends to whom she wanted to
give presents, and though she had brought
home a lot of what Kenneth called &#8220;foreign
junk,&#8221; she had no notion of giving it all away.
</p>
<p>Of course, the lovely fans, beads, and scarves
she brought made lovely gifts for the girls, and
the little curios and souvenirs were all right for
the boys, but there were so many friends, and
her relatives beside, that she soon realised she
would have little left for herself. And, though
unselfish, she did want to retain some mementos
of her foreign trip.
</p>
<p>So shopping was necessary, and nearly every
day she went with Nan or Elise to buy the
Christmas wares that the city shops displayed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I do think,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that things are
just as pretty and just as cheap here as over
there.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Some things,&#8221; agreed Nan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I mean just the regular wares. Of
course, for Roman silks and Florentine mosaics
it&#8217;s better to shop where they grow. What&#8217;s
father going to give me, Nan?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Inquisitive creature! I shouldn&#8217;t tell you if
I knew, but as I don&#8217;t know, and he doesn&#8217;t
either, I may as well tell you that he&#8217;d be glad
of a hint. What would you like?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Honestly, I don&#8217;t know of a thing! Isn&#8217;t
it awful to have everything you want?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a contented little girl, Patty. And
that&#8217;s a noble trait, I admit. But just at Christmas
time it&#8217;s trying. Now, if you only wanted
a watch, or a diamond ring, or some trifle like
that, I&#8217;d be glad to give your father a hint.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, stepmamma,&#8221; said Patty, smiling;
&#8220;but I have a watch, and I&#8217;m too young
for diamonds. I can&#8217;t help it if I&#8217;m amply supplied
with this world&#8217;s goods. And think of
the lots of gifts I&#8217;ll get, anyway! Perhaps
father&#8217;d better just give me the money and let
me put it in the bank against a rainy day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Patty, you&#8217;re not getting mercenary, I
hope! What do you want of money in the
bank?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty looked earnest.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m mercenary,&#8221; she said,
slowly, &#8220;but, Nan, you never know what may
happen. Suppose father should lose all his
money.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense! he can&#8217;t do that. It&#8217;s most carefully
invested, and you know, Patty, he thinks
of retiring from business in a year or two more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; said Patty, with a little sigh. &#8220;I
know we&#8217;re rich. Not wealthy, like the Farringtons,
but plenty rich enough. Only, you
often hear of rich men losing their money, and
sometimes I think I ought to save up some.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Goosie!&#8221; said Nan, smiling fondly at her;
&#8220;don&#8217;t bother your curly head about such things
before it&#8217;s necessary.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, then, I won&#8217;t,&#8221; said Patty, shaking
the curly head and smiling back.
</p>
<p>That afternoon she went to see Clementine
Morse. Clementine had called one day when
Patty was not at home, so this was the first time
the girls had met since Patty&#8217;s return.
</p>
<p>The maid asked Patty to go right up to Clementine&#8217;s
own room, and there Patty found her
friend surrounded by what looked like a whirlwind
of rainbow-coloured rags.
</p>
<p>On tables, chairs, and even on the floor, were
scraps and bits of silks, satins, ribbons, and laces,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
and in a low chair sat Clementine, sewing rapidly,
as if for dear life.
</p>
<p>But at sight of Patty, she jumped up, upsetting
her work-basket, and flew to greet her
guest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You dear thing!&#8221; she cried, as she embraced
her; &#8220;I was so sorry not to see you when I
called. I should have come again, but I&#8217;m so
rushed with Christmas work, that I can&#8217;t go
anywhere until Christmas is over. Do take off
your things and sit down, and don&#8217;t mind if I
go on sewing, will you? I can talk just as well,
you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Apparently you can!&#8221; said Patty, laughing,
for as she chatted, Clementine had already resumed
her work, and her fingers flew nimbly
along the satin seams. &#8220;What <i>are</i> you doing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dressing dolls,&#8221; said Clementine, as she
threaded her needle; &#8220;and I&#8217;ve forty-five still
to do,&mdash;but their underclothing is done, so it&#8217;s
only a matter of frocks, and some hats. Did
you have a good time in Europe?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Clementine talked very fast, apparently to keep
time with her flying fingers, and as Patty picked
up a lot of dry goods in order that she might
occupy the chair they were in, her hostess rattled
on.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How did you like Venice? Was it lovely by
moonlight? Oh, would you put this scarlet
velvet on the spangled lace,&mdash;or save it for this
white chiffon?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Clementine! do keep still a minute!&#8221; cried
Patty; &#8220;you&#8217;ll drive me frantic! What <i>are</i> you
doing with all these dolls?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dressing them. How did you like Paris?
Was it very gay? And was London smoky,&mdash;foggy,
I mean?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; everything was gay or smoky or lovely
by moonlight, or just what it ought to be. Now
tell me <i>why</i> you dress four hundred million dolls
all at once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, they&#8217;re for the Sunshine Babies. Was
Naples very dirty? How did you like&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Clementine, you leave the map of Europe
alone. I&#8217;m talking now! What are Sunshine
Babies?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, the babies that the Sunshine Society
gives a Christmas to. And there&#8217;s oceans of
babies, and they all want dolls,&mdash;I guess the
boys must like dolls, too, they want so many.
And, oh, Patty, they&#8217;re the dearest little things,&mdash;the
babies, I mean,&mdash;and I just <i>love</i> to dress
dolls for them. I&#8217;d rather do it than to make
presents for my rich friends.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></p>
<p>Suddenly Patty felt a great wave of self-compunction.
She had planned and prepared gifts
for all her friends, and for most of her relatives,
but for the poor she had done nothing! To
charity she had given no thought! And at
Christmas, when all the world should feel the
spirit of good will to men, she had utterly neglected
to remember those less fortunate than
herself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; said Clementine, dismayed
by Patty&#8217;s expression of remorse.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a pig!&#8221; said Patty; &#8220;there&#8217;s no other
word for such a horrid thing as I am! Why,
Clementine, I&#8217;ve made presents for nearly everybody
I know, and I haven&#8217;t done a thing for
charity! Did you ever know such an ungrateful
wretch?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it isn&#8217;t too late, yet,&#8221; said Clementine,
not quite understanding why Patty was so serious
about it; &#8220;here, help me sew these.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She tossed her some tiny satin sleeves, already
cut and basted, and offered a furnished work-basket.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Deed I will!&#8221; said Patty, and in a few moments
she too was sewing, as deftly, if not quite
so rapidly, as Clementine.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, Clem,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been so
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
busy ever since I came home, that I simply forgot
the poor people. And now it&#8217;s too late.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too late to make things,&#8221; agreed Clementine,
&#8220;but not too late to buy them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ve spent all my Christmas money,&#8221;
said Patty, contritely. &#8220;Father gives me a liberal
allowance, and then extra, for Christmas
money. And it&#8217;s just about all gone, and I hate
to ask him for more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, never mind, Patsy, you can make up
for it next year. And if you help me dress these
dolls, that will square up your conscience.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it won&#8217;t. But I&#8217;ll find a way to do something,
somehow. Are these Sunshine people all
babies?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no; the society helps all sorts of poor
people, children and grown-ups too. Mother
is one of the directors, and we do a lot of this
doll-dressing every year.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll help you a while this afternoon,
but I won&#8217;t have another chance. You see just
about every moment is taken up from now till
Christmas.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going to the Farringtons&#8217;, aren&#8217;t
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, for three or four days, while Nan and
father are in Philadelphia at Nan&#8217;s mother&#8217;s.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
You&#8217;re coming to the Christmas Eve dance, of
course?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed. It&#8217;s to be a lovely party. The
Farringtons always have such beautiful entertainments.
Now, Patty, do tell me about your
trip.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So Patty told many tales of her stay in Paris
and in England, and of her pleasure trip through
Italy, and as she talked, her fingers flew, and
she had soon completed three doll dresses, that
were quite as pretty and well-made as Clementine&#8217;s.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, I must go,&#8221; she said, at last. &#8220;I&#8217;m
glad to have been of a little help, and next year
I&#8217;ll help you a lot. Though, I suppose your
Sunshine Babies <i>could</i> have dolls when it isn&#8217;t
Christmas.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; these are for their Tree, you
know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Clem, if I should have some money
left me unexpectedly, is it too late to buy some
toys for the Tree?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Clementine, &#8220;but we
can ask mother. She&#8217;ll know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They found Mrs. Morse in her sitting-room,
tying up parcels and addressing them.
</p>
<p>Patty soon discovered that these were all charitable
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
gifts, and not presents to Mrs. Morse&#8217;s
own friends.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad I came here to-day,&#8221; she said,
after the welcoming greetings were over,
&#8220;for it has roused my charitable instincts.
I am quite sure, Mrs. Morse, I can send
some toys for your society&#8217;s tree, if you want
them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Want them? Indeed we do! Why, Patty,
there are forty little boys who want drums or
trumpets and we can only give them candy and
an orange. It&#8217;s harder than you&#8217;d think to get
subscriptions to our funds at Christmas time,
and though we&#8217;ve dolls enough, we do so want
toys for the boys.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll send you some, Mrs. Morse. I&#8217;ll
send them to-morrow. Do you care what they
are?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed. Drums, or balls, or tin carts,&mdash;anything
that a boy-child can play with.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you may depend on me for the forty,&#8221;
said Patty, smiling, for she had formed a sudden,
secret resolve.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Patty, dear, how kind of you! I am
so glad, for those children were on my mind,
and I&#8217;ve already asked every one I know to give
to our fund. You are a generous little girl, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
I know it will gladden your own heart as well as
the children&#8217;s.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty ran away, and all the way home her heart
was full of her project.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If he will only consent,&#8221; she thought. &#8220;If
not, I don&#8217;t know how I shall keep my promise.
Oh, well, I know I can coax him to say yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>After dinner that evening, Patty put her plan
into action.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Father Fairfield,&#8221; she said, &#8220;what are you
going to give me for a Christmas gift?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Pattykins, that&#8217;s not considered a correct
question in polite society.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let&#8217;s be impolite, just for this once. Do
tell me, daddy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You embarrass me exceedingly, young lady,&#8221;
said Mr. Fairfield, smiling at her, &#8220;for, to tell
you the truth, I haven&#8217;t bought you anything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m so glad!&#8221; exclaimed Patty, &#8220;for,
father, I want to ask you a great favour.
Won&#8217;t you give me the money instead, and let
me spend it as I like?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be a funny Christmas gift. I
thought you liked some pretty trinket, tied up
in holly paper and red ribbons and Santa Claus
seals, and served to you on a silver salver.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I do, from other people. But from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
you, I just want the money that my present
would cost, and&mdash;I want it now!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless my soul! She wants it now! Why,
Patsy, what are you going to do? Buy stock?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but I do want it, father. Won&#8217;t you give
it to me, and I&#8217;ll tell you afterward what I&#8217;m
going to do with it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you now,&#8221; said Nan, smiling at the
pair. &#8220;She&#8217;s going to put it in the bank, because
she&#8217;s afraid she&#8217;ll be poor some day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wonder you think that, stepmothery,&#8221;
said Patty, her eyes twinkling at Nan, &#8220;for I
did tell you so. But since then I&#8217;ve changed my
mind, and though I want my present from
father in cash, I&#8217;m going to spend it before
Christmas, and not put it in the bank at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you are a weathercock, Patty. But before
morning you will have changed your mind
again!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeedy! It&#8217;s made up to stay this time.
So give me the money like a duck of a daddy,
won&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty was very wheedlesome, as she caressed
her father&#8217;s cheek, and smiled into his eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, as you don&#8217;t often make a serious request,
and as you seem to be in dead earnest
this time, I rather think I shall have to say yes.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you dear, good, lovely father!&#8221; cried
Patty, embracing him. &#8220;Will you give it to
me now, and how much will it be?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty,&#8221; said Nan, laughing, &#8220;you&#8217;re positively
sordid! I never saw you so greedy for
money before.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty laughed outright. Now that she had
gained her point she felt in gay spirits.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Friends,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you see before you a
pauper,&mdash;a penniless pauper! Therefore, and
because of which, and by reason of the fact that
I am in immediate need of money, I stoop to
this means of obtaining it, and, as aforesaid, I&#8217;d
like it now!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She held out her rosy palm to her father, and
stood waiting expectantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only one hand!&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Fairfield,
in surprise. &#8220;I thought such a grasping young
woman would expect both hands filled.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Patty, and she promptly extended
her other palm, too.
</p>
<p>Putting both his hands in his pockets, Mr.
Fairfield drew them out again, and then laid a
ten-dollar goldpiece on each of Patty&#8217;s outstretched
palms.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you dear daddy!&#8221; she cried, as she
clasped the gold in her fingers; &#8220;you lovely
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
parent! This is the nicest Christmas gift I
ever had, and now I&#8217;ll tell you all about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So she told them, quite seriously, how she had
really forgotten to give the poor and the suffering
any share of her own Christmas cheer, and
how this was the only way she could think of to
remedy her neglect.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s so lovely,&#8221; she concluded; &#8220;for
there are forty little boy-children. And with
this money I can get them each a fifty-cent
present.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you can,&#8221; said Nan. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go with you
to-morrow to select them. And if we can get
some cheaper than fifty cents, and I think we
can, you&#8217;ll have a little left for extras.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; agreed Patty. &#8220;They often
have lovely toys for about thirty-nine cents, and
I could get some marbles or something to fill
up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To fill up what?&#8221; asked her father.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, to fill up the tree. Or I&#8217;ll get some ornaments,
or some tinsel to decorate it. Oh,
father, you are so good to me! This is a lovely
Christmas present.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>THE DAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS</h3>
</div>

<p>Mr. Fairfield&#8217;s gift to his wife was
a beautiful motor-car, and as they were
going away for the holiday, he presented
it to her the day before Christmas.
</p>
<p>It was practically a gift to Patty as well, for
the whole family could enjoy it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s perfectly lovely,&#8221; said Nan, as they all
started out for a little spin, to try it. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had
so much trouble of late with taxicabs, that it&#8217;s a
genuine comfort to have my own car at my beck
and call. It&#8217;s a lovely car, Fred, and Patty and
I shall just about live in it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to enjoy it,&#8221; returned Mr. Fairfield,
&#8220;and you may have every confidence in
the chauffeur. He&#8217;s most highly recommended
by a man I know well, and he&#8217;s both careful
and skilful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A nice-mannered man, too,&#8221; observed Patty.
&#8220;I like his looks, and his mode of address. But
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
if this car is partly my present, then I ought not
to have had that gold money to buy drums
with.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, you ought,&#8221; said her father. &#8220;That
was your individual gift. In this car you and
Nan are partners. By the way, Puss, did you
ever get your forty drums? I didn&#8217;t hear about
them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re lucky that you didn&#8217;t hear them,&#8221;
laughed Patty. &#8220;Yes, I did get them,&mdash;not all
drums, some other toys,&mdash;and I took them down
to the Sunshine place yesterday. I went with
Mrs. Morse and Clementine. You know the
kiddywids had their Christmas tree, the little
poor children, and such a noise you never heard!
They yelled and shouted for glee, and they
banged drums and tooted horns, and then they
sang songs, and I think I never knew such a
noisy celebration, even on the fourth of July.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And were they glad to get your gifts?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, indeed! Why, just think, father,
the little girls all had dolls, but if I hadn&#8217;t taken
the gifts for the boys, they would only have had
candy or an orange. Next Christmas I&#8217;m
going to do more for them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to see your charitable spirit waking
up, Patty-girl. I don&#8217;t want you to be a mere
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
social butterfly. But, you know, you needn&#8217;t
wait for Christmas to make the poor babies
happy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I know it, daddy, dear; and after Christmas
is over, I&#8217;m going to try to do some good
in the world.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Patty,&#8221; said Nan, &#8220;don&#8217;t you go in
for settlement work, and that sort of thing. I
won&#8217;t let you. You&#8217;re not strong enough for it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know exactly what settlement work
is,&#8221; said Patty, &#8220;but I do know I&#8217;m not going
to be a mere butterfly. I&#8217;m going to accomplish
something worth while.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, wait till the holiday season is over,&#8221;
advised Mr. Fairfield. &#8220;You&#8217;ve made forty
boys happy, now turn your attention to making
your family and friends happy. What are you
going to give your poor old father for a Christmas
gift, I should like to know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t any such relative as you describe,&#8221;
returned Patty, smiling at him affectionately.
&#8220;I have a young and handsome father, and I
think he seems to be rather a rich gentleman.
Also I have a gift awaiting him at home, and I
think we&#8217;d better be going there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do, too,&#8221; said Nan. &#8220;We&#8217;ve none too
much time to get our luncheon and go to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
train. Oh! what a comfort it will be to go to
the train in our own motor-car.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Patty, &#8220;and then Miller can come
back and take me over to Elise&#8217;s.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So home they went, and had their own little
Christmas celebration, before they went their
separate ways.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a make-believe Christmas feast,&#8221; said
Patty, as they sat at their own luncheon table.
</p>
<p>She had placed a sprig of holly at each plate,
and a vase of poinsettia blossoms graced the
centre of the table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This ox-tail soup is in place of the boar&#8217;s
head,&#8221; she went on, gaily; &#8220;and I know we are
going to have chicken croquettes, which we will
pretend are the roast turkey. And then we&#8217;ll
have our presents, as I know you two will fly for
your train as soon as you leave the table.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So Patty gave Nan her present, which was a
lovely white couch pillow of lace and embroidery.
And Nan gave Patty a picture to hang in
her own room. It was a beautiful water-colour,
a Venetian scene, and Patty was delighted
with it.
</p>
<p>Then Patty gave her father a gold penholder,
which she had had made expressly for him, and
engraved with his name.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why, that&#8217;s fine, Pattykins!&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;I can only write poems with a pen like that.
It&#8217;s not made for business letters, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course it isn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Patty, gaily; &#8220;it&#8217;s
to keep on your desk in the library here at home.
And you must use it just for social correspondence
or&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Or to sign checks for us,&#8221; suggested Nan,
smiling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what I&#8217;ll do with it,&#8221; declared
Mr. Fairfield. &#8220;It&#8217;s a gem of a pen; Patty,
you know my weakness for fine desk appointments,
don&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nan gave her husband a watch fob, on which
hung a locket containing a miniature of her own
sweet face. Neither Patty nor her father had
seen this before, as Nan had been careful to
keep the matter secret in order to surprise
them.
</p>
<p>It was a real work of art, and so winsome was
the pictured face that Patty cried out in admiration:
&#8220;What a stunner you are, Nan! I didn&#8217;t
realise you were so good-looking,&mdash;but it&#8217;s exactly
like you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a mixed-up compliment, Patty,&#8221;
laughed Nan, &#8220;but I&#8217;ll surmise that you mean
well.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I do so! I think it&#8217;s a lovely picture of a
lovely lady! There, how&#8217;s that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Much better,&#8221; said Nan, as Patty caught her
round the shoulders and kissed her affectionately.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me the lady,&#8221; said Mr. Fairfield, taking
Nan into his own arms. &#8220;As the portrait
is a gift to me, I will kiss her for it, myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do,&#8221; said Patty, &#8220;but if you give her more
than three kisses, you&#8217;ll lose your train; it&#8217;s getting
pretty late.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it?&#8221; cried Mr. Fairfield. &#8220;Then, Jane,
bring in those two boxes I left in your charge,
will you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; cried the waitress, and, leaving the
room, she returned in a moment with two large
white boxes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;These are Christmas gifts to the two loveliest
ladies I know,&#8221; said Mr. Fairfield, gallantly
tendering a box to each.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ve had my Christmas gift from you!&#8221;
exclaimed Patty, and &#8220;So have I!&#8221; cried
Nan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nevertheless these are laid at your feet,&#8221;
said Mr. Fairfield, calmly depositing the boxes
on the floor in front of them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, we may as well see what they are,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
said Patty, untying the white ribbons that fastened
her box.
</p>
<p>Nan did likewise, and in a moment they were
both rapturously exclaiming over two sets of
white furs that nestled in billows of white tissue
paper.
</p>
<p>Nan&#8217;s furs were ermine, and Patty&#8217;s were
soft, fluffy, white fox, and so beautiful were they
that the two recipients donned them at once, and
posed side by side before the mirror, admiring
themselves and each other. Then, with a simultaneous
impulse they turned to thank the donor,
and Mr. Fairfield found himself suddenly entangled
in four arms and two boas, while two
immense muffs met at the back of his neck and
enveloped his head and ears.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have mercy!&#8221; he cried; &#8220;come one at a
time, can&#8217;t you? Yes, yes, I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re
pleased, but do get this fur out of my
mouth! I feel as if I were attacked by polar
bears!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Fathery Fairfield,&#8221; Patty cried, &#8220;you
are the dearest thing in the world! How <i>did</i>
you know I wanted furs? And white fox, of all
things! And ermine for Nan! Oh, but you
<i>are</i> a good gentleman! Isn&#8217;t he, stepmother?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll do,&#8221; said Nan, smiling roguishly at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
her husband, who, somehow, seemed satisfied
with this faint praise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, scamper, Nan-girl,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;if you
would see your mother to-day, you must leave
here in less than an hour. Can you be ready?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t, but I will,&#8221; replied Nan, gaily, as she
ran away to prepare for her journey.
</p>
<p>Patty, too, went to her room to get ready for
her visit at the Farringtons&#8217;. She was to stay
three days, and as there were several parties
planned for her entertainment, she packed a
small trunk with several of her prettiest gowns.
Also, she had a suitcase full of gifts for the
Christmas tree, which was to be part of the
festivities.
</p>
<p>She bade her parents good-by when they
started, and watched the new motor-car disappear
round the corner, then returned to her own
preparations.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do have lovely things,&#8221; she thought to herself,
as she folded her dainty garments and laid
them in their places.
</p>
<p>Then she glanced again at her new furs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have too much,&#8221; she thought; &#8220;it isn&#8217;t fair
for one girl to have so much, when so many
poor people have nothing. I wonder what I
ought to do about it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>Poor Patty was confronting the problem that
has troubled and baffled so many honest hearts,
but the more she thought about it, the more it
seemed insoluble.
</p>
<p>&#8220;At any rate, it would be absurd to give my
white furs, or my chiffon frocks to poor people,&#8221;
she concluded, &#8220;for they couldn&#8217;t use them.
Well, after the holidays, I&#8217;m going to see what
I can do. But now, I must hurry, or I&#8217;ll be
late.&#8221;
</p>
<p>An hour or two later, she found herself in the
Farringtons&#8217; home.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What lovely furs, Patty,&#8221; exclaimed Mrs.
Farrington, &#8220;and how well they suit you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>They were extremely becoming, and Patty&#8217;s
pretty face, with its soft colour and smiling
eyes, rose like a flower from the white fur at
her throat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, aren&#8217;t they beautiful?&#8221; Patty responded.
&#8220;Father just gave them to me, and
I&#8217;m so pleased with them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And well you may be. Now, you girls run
away and play, for I&#8217;ve a thousand things to
do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Indeed, Mrs. Farrington was in a whirlpool of
presents that she was both sending and receiving.
Maids and footmen were running hither and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
thither, bringing messages or carrying out orders,
and as the whole house was full of warmth
and light, and the spicy fragrance of Christmas
greens, Patty fairly revelled in the pleasant
atmosphere.
</p>
<p>She was of a nature very susceptible to surroundings.
Like a cat, she loved to bask in
warm sunshine, or in a luxurious, softly-furnished
place. Moreover, she was fond of Elise,
and so looked forward to her three days&#8217; visit
with glad anticipation.
</p>
<p>After Patty had laid aside her things, the two
girls sat down to chat in the big hall on the second
floor of the mansion. A wood-fire was
blazing, and soft, red-shaded lights cast a delightful
glow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Elise,&#8221; said Patty, somewhat suddenly,
&#8220;don&#8217;t you think we have too much riches and
things?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Elise stared at her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>Patty laughed at her friend&#8217;s blank expression,
but she went on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean just what I say. Of course, you have
lots more riches and things than I have; but I
think we all have too much when we think of
the poor people who haven&#8217;t any.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you mean Socialism,&#8221; exclaimed Elise,
suddenly enlightened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t mean Socialism. I mean plain,
every-day charity. Don&#8217;t you think we ought
to give away more?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes, if you like,&#8221; said Elise, who was
greatly puzzled. &#8220;Do you want me to subscribe
to some charity? I will.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, perhaps I&#8217;ll hold you to that,&#8221; said
Patty, slowly; &#8220;for after the holidays I&#8217;m going
to try to do something in the matter. I don&#8217;t
know just what; I haven&#8217;t thought it out yet.
But I&#8217;m not going to be what my father calls a
&#8216;mere social butterfly,&#8217; and I don&#8217;t believe you
want to, either.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t; but do leave it all till after the
holidays, Patty, for now I want you to help me
with some Christmas presents.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Elise looked so worried and so beseeching that
Patty laughed. Then she kissed her, and said:
&#8220;All right, Lisa mine. Command me. My
services are at your disposal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So the girls went up to the Sun Parlour, where
Elise had all her choicest belongings, and where
she now had her array of Christmas gifts.
</p>
<p>The room was entirely of glass, and by a careful
arrangement of double panes and concealed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
heat-pipes, was made comfortable even in the
coldest weather. Flowers and plants were round
the sides; birds in gilt cages sang and twittered;
and gilt wicker furniture gave the place a dainty
French effect that was charming. On the tables
were strewn Christmas gifts of all sorts.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just tying up the last ones,&#8221; said Elise.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid to look; yours is safely hidden
away. Now, here&#8217;s what I want to know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She picked up a gold seal ring, which, however,
had no crest or monogram cut on it,&mdash;and
a bronze paper cutter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re lovely,&#8221; said Patty, as she looked
at them. &#8220;Who catches these?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what I don&#8217;t know. I bought the
ring for Roger and the paper cutter for Kenneth
Harper; he&#8217;s coming to-night. But I&#8217;d like to
change them about and give the ring to Ken,
and the paper knife to Roger. Would you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Patty, bluntly. &#8220;Why
do you want to do such a thing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The ring is much the handsomer gift,&#8221; said
Elise, who had turned a trifle pink.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course it is,&#8221; said Patty, &#8220;and that&#8217;s
why you should give it to your brother. It&#8217;s
too personal a gift to give to a boy friend.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I was afraid of,&#8221; said Elise,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
with a little sigh. &#8220;But Roger won&#8217;t care for it
at all, and Kenneth would like it heaps.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Because</i> you gave it to him?&#8221; asked Patty,
quickly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know. Yes, perhaps so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense, Elise! You&#8217;re too young to give
rings to young men.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ken isn&#8217;t a young man, he&#8217;s only a boy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s over twenty-one; and anyway, I
know it wouldn&#8217;t be right for you to give him a
ring. Your mother wouldn&#8217;t like it at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, she wouldn&#8217;t care.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, she ought to, and I think she would.
Now, don&#8217;t be silly; give the ring to Roger,
and if you want something grander than this
bronze jig for Ken, get him a book. As handsome
a book as you choose; but a book. Or
something that&#8217;s impersonal. Not a ring or a
watch-fob, or anything like that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But he gave you a necklace,&mdash;the day we
sailed for Paris.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fiddle-de-dee! It was only a locket, with
the merest thread of a gold chain; and anyway,
I never wore it but once or twice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you oughtn&#8217;t to have accepted it, if a
personal gift is so reprehensible.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Elise, you&#8217;re a goose!&#8221; said Patty, losing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
her patience at last. &#8220;A gift like that is not in
very good taste from a boy to a girl; but from a
girl to a boy, it&#8217;s very much worse. And, anyway,
it was different in my case; for Ken and I
are old friends, which you and he are not. And,
beside, father knew about it, and he said as a
parting keepsake it was all right. But at a
Christmas tree, in your own house,&mdash;Elise,
you&#8217;ll make a great mistake if you give Kenneth
Harper a seal ring.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Patty, you know I always do just
as you say, so I&#8217;ll give it to Roger.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty knew she had judged rightly in the matter,
but she also knew that Elise was greatly
disappointed at her decision.
</p>
<p>She had already noticed that Elise liked handsome
Kenneth, but if she did, that was only an
added reason why she should not make him a
present of a ring.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She ought to have had more sense!&#8221; Patty
said to herself, indignantly. &#8220;And I&#8217;m sorry
if she&#8217;s sorry; but I couldn&#8217;t let her do such a
foolish thing!&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>A SPLENDID TREE</h3>
</div>

<p>The Christmas Eve dinner was set for an
early hour, that the younger Farrington
children might take part in the festivities.
</p>
<p>Beside Elise and Roger, there were two
younger girls, Louise and Hester, and Bobby,
aged ten.
</p>
<p>When Patty went down to the drawing-room,
she found these three eager with anticipation of
the Christmas frolic about to begin.
</p>
<p>Kenneth Harper was there too, but there were
no other guests, as this evening was to be a
family celebration. Soon the other members of
the household appeared, and then dinner was
announced, and they all went to the dining-room.
</p>
<p>Mr. Farrington offered his arm to Patty, and
escorted her out first, as guest of honour. Mrs.
Farrington followed with Kenneth, and then
the five Farrington children came out less formally.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></p>
<p>A burst of applause greeted their first
sight of the dinner table. It was indeed
a Christmas feast to the eye as well as to the
palate.
</p>
<p>In the centre of the table was a Christmas tree,
decorated with tinsel and gay ornaments, and
lighted by tiny electric bulbs.
</p>
<p>At each plate also, was a tiny Christmas tree,
whose box-shaped standards bore the names of
the diners.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s mine!&#8221; cried Bobby, as he slid into
his chair. &#8220;Oh, what a jolly dinner!&#8221;
</p>
<p>On the little place trees hung nuts and bonbons
which were to be eaten, &#8220;at the pleasure
of the performer,&#8221; as Roger expressed it.
</p>
<p>The table was also decked with holly and red
ribbons, and the various viands, as they were
served, were shaped or decorated in keeping
with the occasion.
</p>
<p>The Farrington household was conducted on
a most elaborate plan, and their dinners were
usually very formal and conventional. But to-night
was an exception, and, save for the solemn
butler and grave footmen, everybody in the
room was bubbling over with laughter and merriment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not hungry any more,&#8221; declared Bobby,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
after he had done full justice to several courses;
&#8220;let&#8217;s hurry up, and have the tree.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait, Bobs,&#8221; advised Hester; &#8220;we haven&#8217;t
had the ice cream yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s so,&#8221; said Bobby; &#8220;can&#8217;t we have
it now, mother, and skip these flummerydiddles?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He looked scornfully at the dainty salad that
had just been placed before him, but Mrs. Farrington
only smiled, not caring to remind him
of the laws of table etiquette on a festive occasion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have patience, Bobby, dear,&#8221; she said; &#8220;the
ice cream will come next; and, too, you know the
longer the dinner, the later you can sit up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so!&#8221; agreed Bobby. &#8220;My, but Christmas Eve is fun!
Wish I could sit up late every night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But it wouldn&#8217;t be Christmas Eve every
night,&#8221; said Patty, smiling at the chubby-faced
boy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so! Neither no more it wouldn&#8217;t!
Well, I wish it was Christmas Eve every night,
then!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; laughed Patty. &#8220;Make a
good big wish while you&#8217;re about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then the ice cream was served and of course
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
it was in shapes of Christmas trees, and Santa
Clauses, and sprigs of holly, and Christmas
bells, and Patty&#8217;s portion was a lovely spray
of mistletoe bough.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ho, ho!&#8221; laughed Kenneth, seeing it across
the table; &#8220;another good chance lost! You
know the penalty, Patty, if you&#8217;re caught under
the mistletoe. But of course if you eat mistletoe,
the charm fails.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m willing it should,&#8221; said Patty, as she took
up her spoon. &#8220;I&#8217;m not pining for a rustic
swain to kiss me &#8217;neath the mistletoe bough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty looked very roguish and provoking as
she said this, and Mr. Farrington said, gallantly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, no, perhaps not. But the swains are
doing the pining, without doubt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Now Roger sat on the other side of Patty, and
as his father finished speaking, he said, apparently
apropos of nothing:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother, are these your Spode plates, or are
they Cauldon ware?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re Spode, Roger; why do you want to
know? Are you suddenly becoming interested
in China?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he replied; &#8220;are you sure, mother,
these are Spode?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span></p>
<p>He lifted the handsome plate in front of him,
and gazed intently at the mark on its under
side, as he held it just above the level of his
eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Be careful, Roger, you&#8217;ll spill your ice
cream,&#8221; admonished his father.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I won&#8217;t, sir,&#8221; he said, as he replaced his
plate. &#8220;But I never saw Spode with this decoration
before. Let me look at yours, Patty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He took up Patty&#8217;s plate of ice cream, and
lifting it quite high studied the stamp on
that.
</p>
<p>Suddenly he moved it, until the dish of mistletoe
ice cream was directly over Patty&#8217;s head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fairly caught!&#8221; he cried; &#8220;under the mistletoe!&#8221;
And before Patty caught the jest, Roger
had kissed her pretty pink cheek, and then
calmly restored her plate of ice cream to its
place in front of her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You villain!&#8221; she cried, glaring at him, and
pretending to be greatly offended, but smiling in
spite of herself at his clever ruse.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good for you, my boy!&#8221; cried Mr. Farrington,
clapping his hands. &#8220;I wish I had
thought of that myself. But it&#8217;s a game that
won&#8217;t work twice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed it won&#8217;t!&#8221; said Patty, &#8220;I&#8217;ll take care
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
of that!&#8221; and she began to eat her mistletoe ice
cream in proof of her words.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It never can happen again,&#8221; said Kenneth, in
sad tones, as he watched the &#8220;mistletoe&#8221; disappear.
&#8220;But I&#8217;ll not give up all hope. It&#8217;s
still Christmas Eve, and there are other mistletoes
and other manners.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And other girls,&#8221; said Patty, glancing mischievously
at Elise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, there are four of us,&#8221; said Louise, so
innocently that they all laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Louise,&#8221; said Kenneth, &#8220;you find
a nice, big spray of mistletoe, after dinner, and
wear it in that big topknot bow of yours, and
I&#8217;ll promise to kiss you on both cheeks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Louise was too shy to respond to this
repartee, and she dropped her eyes in confusion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Mrs. Farrington, as she rose
from the table, &#8220;we&#8217;ll have our Christmas
Waits sing carols, and then we&#8217;ll have our tree.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The children understood this, and Hester and
Bobby at once ran out of the room. A few moments
later they returned, dressed in trailing
white robes, like surplices, and before they
reached the drawing-room, their childish voices
could be heard singing old-fashioned carols.
</p>
<p>They had been well trained, and sang very
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
prettily, and as they appeared in the doorway,
Patty could scarcely believe that these demure
little white-robed figures were the two merry
children.
</p>
<p>After two or three carols by the &#8220;Waits,&#8221; the
whole party joined in a Christmas chorus, and
Patty&#8217;s clear soprano rang out sweetly in the
harmony.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What a lovely voice you have, Patty, dear,&#8221;
said Mrs. Farrington, as the song was done;
&#8220;it has improved greatly since I heard you last.
Are you taking lessons?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall, Mrs. Farrington, after we get fairly
settled. Father wants me to begin as soon as
he can find the right teacher.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed; you must do so. It would be a
shame not to cultivate such a talent as that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You <i>have</i> improved, Patty!&#8221; declared Kenneth.
&#8220;My! but your voice is stunning. I expect
we&#8217;ll see you on the concert stage yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;More likely on a Fifth Avenue stage,&#8221; said
Patty, laughing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now for the tree!&#8221; exclaimed Bobby, who
had thrown aside his white robe, and was ready
for the fun to begin.
</p>
<p>The tree had been set up in the indoor tennis-court,
which was in the Casino.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></p>
<p>This Casino, practically another house, opened
from the great hall of the Farrington mansion,
and its various apartments were devoted to different
sorts of amusements.
</p>
<p>The tennis court made a fine setting for the
Christmas celebration, and had been carefully
prepared for the great event.
</p>
<p>The floor was covered with white canton flannel,
so arranged over slight ridges and hummocks
that it looked exactly like a field of
drifted snow.
</p>
<p>The tree, at the end of the room, was the
largest that could be obtained, and was loaded
with beautiful ornaments and decorations, and
glittering with electric lights of all colours.
</p>
<p>Patty had seen many Christmas trees, but
never such a large or splendid one, and it almost
took her breath away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know trees ever grew so big,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;How <i>did</i> you get it into the house?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It <i>was</i> difficult,&#8221; said Mr. Farrington. &#8220;I
had to engineer the job myself. But Bobby
asked for a big tree, and as the children are
growing up so fast, I wanted to humour him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As Patty had often said, &#8220;for a millionaire,
Mr. Farrington was the kindest man she ever
knew.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></p>
<p>Though wealthy, he had no desire for display
or ostentatious extravagance, but he loved to
please his children, and was sufficiently rewarded
by their enjoyment of the pleasures he provided.
</p>
<p>Now, he was as frankly delighted with Bobby&#8217;s
enthusiasm as Bobby was with his tree.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, old chappie,&#8221; he cried; &#8220;you shall
be Santa Claus, and distribute the gifts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Meantime, the older ones were admiring the
decorations of the room. Round the walls were
smaller evergreen trees of varying heights, giving
the effect of a clearing in a grove of evergreens.
The ceiling had been draped across with
dark blue material, and was studded with stars,
made of tiny electric lights.
</p>
<p>Bunches and wreaths of holly, tied with red
ribbons, gave a touch of colour to the general
effect, and in one corner beneath a green arched
bower, a chime of bells pealed softly at intervals.
</p>
<p>Altogether, the whole place breathed the very
spirit of Christmas, and so perfect were the appointments,
that no false note marred the harmony
of it all.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now for the presents!&#8221; cried Bobby. &#8220;Oh,
daddy, there&#8217;s my &#8217;lectric railroad! Won&#8217;t you
other people wait till I see how it works?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></p>
<p>The others all laughed at the eager, apologetic
little face, as Bobby found it impossible to curb
his impatience to see his new toy.
</p>
<p>It was indeed a fine electric railway, and every
one became interested as Mr. Farrington began
to take it from its box and put the parts together.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the way it goes, dad,&#8221; said Roger,
kneeling on the floor beside his father.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, this way,&#8221; said Kenneth, as he adjusted
some of the parts.
</p>
<p>Quite content to wait for their gifts, Mrs.
Farrington and the girls stood round watching
the proceedings with interest, and soon Patty
and Elise were down on the floor, too, breathlessly
waiting the completion of the structure,
and cheering gaily as the first train went successfully
round the long track. Other trains
followed, switches were set, signals opened or
closed, bridges crossed, and all the man&oelig;uvres
of a real railroad repeated in miniature.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t had so much fun since I was a
kid,&#8221; said Kenneth, rising from the floor
and mopping his heated brow with his handkerchief.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor I!&#8221; declared Mr. Farrington. &#8220;I&#8217;d
rather rig up that toy for that boy of mine than&mdash;than
to own a real railroad!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you would!&#8221; said his wife, laughing.
&#8220;And now, suppose you see what Santa
Claus has for the rest of us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Father&#8217;s all in,&#8221; said Roger. &#8220;You sit on
that heap of snow, dad, and Kenneth and I will
unload these groaning branches.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bobby was too absorbed in his cars to think of
anything else, so the little girls acted as messengers
to distribute the gifts from the tree.
</p>
<p>And this performance was a lengthy one.
</p>
<p>Parcel after parcel, daintily wrapped and tied,
was given to Patty, and, of course, the Farringtons
had many more.
</p>
<p>But Patty had a great quantity, for knowing
where she was to spend her Christmas, all her
young friends had sent gifts to her at the Farringtons&#8217;,
and the accumulation was almost as
great as Elise&#8217;s.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m helpless,&#8221; said Patty, as she sat with her
lap full of gifts, boxes and papers strewn all
about her on the floor, and Louise or Hester still
bringing her more parcels.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me help you,&#8221; said Kenneth, as he picked
up a lot of her belongings.
</p>
<p>As he was only a dinner guest, of course Kenneth
had no such array of gifts, though the
Farringtons had given him some pretty trifles,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
and Patty gave him a charming little Tanagra
statuette she had brought from Florence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;See what Elise gave me,&#8221; he remarked, as he
showed the bronze paper-knife. &#8220;Jolly, isn&#8217;t
it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed,&#8221; returned Patty, relieved to see
that Elise had not given him the ring after all.
&#8220;It&#8217;ll be fine to cut your briefs when you&#8217;re a
real out-and-out lawyer. What are briefs, anyway?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Little girls shouldn&#8217;t use words of which they
don&#8217;t know the meaning,&#8221; said Kenneth, reprovingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, anyway, if they&#8217;re brief enough, they
won&#8217;t need cutting,&#8221; returned Patty, saucily, and
then returned to the opening of her own presents.
</p>
<p>She had pretty little gifts from Hilda Henderson,
Lorraine Hamilton, Clementine Morse, and
many of the other girls, some of whom she had
not seen since her return to New York.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it lovely to have so many friends?&#8221; said
she, looking over her pile of gifts at Kenneth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you love them all?&#8221; he asked, smiling
back at her happy face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, indeed I do. Not exactly because they&#8217;ve
given me all these pretty things, for I love the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
girls just as much in the summer time as at
Christmas. But because they&#8217;re my friends, and
so,&mdash;I love them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys are your friends, too,&#8221; suggested Kenneth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course they are!&#8221; Patty agreed; &#8220;and I
love them, too. I guess I love everybody.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather a big order,&#8221; said Roger, coming up
just then. &#8220;Loving everybody, you can&#8217;t give
a very large portion to each one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Patty, pretending to look downcast.
&#8220;Now, isn&#8217;t that <i>too</i> bad! Well, never
mind, I&#8217;ve plenty of gratitude to go round, anyway.
And I offer you a big share of that, Roger,
for this silver box.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you like it? Oh, please like it,
Patty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I do; it&#8217;s exquisite workmanship,
and I shall use it for,&mdash;well, it seems most too
prosaic,&mdash;but it&#8217;s exactly the right shape and
size for hairpins!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then use it for &#8217;em! Why not?&#8221; cried
Roger, evidently pleased that Patty could find
a use for his gift.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And see what Ken gave me,&#8221; went on Patty,
as she held up a small crystal ball. &#8220;I&#8217;ve long
wanted a crystal, and this is a beauty.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s it for?&#8221; asked Roger, curiously; &#8220;it
looks like a marble.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Marble, indeed! Why, Roger, it&#8217;s a crystal,
a Japanese rock crystal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it glass?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, ignorant one! &#8217;Tis not glass, but a
curio of rare and occult value. In it I read the
future, the past, and the present.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is a present, I know,&#8221; said Roger, and
in the laugh at this sally the subject was
dropped, but Roger secretly vowed to look up
the subject of crystals and find out why Patty
was so pleased with a marble.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Elise is simply snowed under,&#8221; said Kenneth,
as they heard rapturous exclamations from the
other side of the room, where Elise was examining
her gifts.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Think of it!&#8221; cried Patty; &#8220;she had everything
a girl could possibly want yesterday, and
now to-day she has a few bushels more!&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was literally true. Getting free, somehow,
of her own impedimenta, Patty ran over to see
Elise&#8217;s things.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You look like a fancy bazaar gone to smash,&#8221;
she declared, as she saw Elise in the midst of her
Christmas portion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel like an International Exhibition,&#8221; returned
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
Elise. &#8220;I&#8217;ve gifts from all parts of the
known world!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And unknown!&#8221; said Kenneth, picking up
various gimcracks of whose name or use he had
no idea.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But this is what I like best,&#8221; she went on,
smiling at Kenneth, as she held up the dainty
little card-case he had given her. &#8220;I shall use
this only when calling on my dearest friends.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good for you!&#8221; he returned. &#8220;Glad you
like it. And as I know you&#8217;ve lots of dearest
friends, I&#8217;ll promise, when it&#8217;s worn out, to give
you another.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Elise looked a trifle disappointed at this offhand
response to her more earnest speech, but
she only smiled gaily, and turned the subject.

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>SKATING AND DANCING</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Kenneth thinks an awful lot of you,
Patty,&#8221; said Elise, as, after the Christmas
party was all over, the girls were
indulging in a good-night chat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh,&#8221; said Patty, who, in kimono and bedroom
slippers, nestled in a big easy-chair in front
of the wood-fire in Elise&#8217;s dressing-room. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
known Ken for years, and we do think a lot of
each other. But you needn&#8217;t take that tone,
Elise. It&#8217;s a boy and girl chumminess, and you
know it. Why, Ken doesn&#8217;t think any more of
me than Roger does.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Roger! Why, he&#8217;s perfectly gone on
you. He worships the ground you walk on.
Surely, Patty, you&#8217;ve noticed Roger&#8217;s devotion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you, Elise? Where&#8217;d
you get these crazy notions about devotion and
worship? If you&#8217;ll excuse my French,&mdash;you
make me tired!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you like to have the boys devoted to
you, Patty?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t! I like their jolly friendship,
of course. I like to talk to Ken and Roger, or
to Clifford Morse, or any of the boys of our
set; but as for <i>devotion</i>, I don&#8217;t see any.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;None so blind as those who won&#8217;t see,&#8221; said
Elise, who had finished brushing her hair, and
now sank down on an ottoman by Patty&#8217;s side.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, I&#8217;ll stay blind, for I don&#8217;t want to
see devoted swains worshipping the Persian
rugs I walk on! Though if you mean these
beautiful rugs that are on all the floors of your
house, Elise, I don&#8217;t know that I blame the
swains so much. By the way, I suppose some of
them are &#8216;prayer rugs&#8217; anyway, so that makes
it all the more appropriate.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Patty, you&#8217;re such a silly! You&#8217;re not
like other girls.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You surprise me, Elise! Also you flatter me!
I had an idea I belonged to the common herd.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty, <i>will</i> you be serious? Roger is terribly
in love with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Really, Elise? How interesting! Now, what
would you do in a case like that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d consider it seriously, at any rate.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty put one finger to her forehead, frowned
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
deeply, and gazed into the fire for fully half a
minute. Then she said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve considered, Elise, and all I can think of
is the &#8216;Cow who considered very well and gave
the piper a penny.&#8217; Do you suppose Roger
would care for a penny?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He would, if you gave it to him,&#8221; returned
Elise, who was almost petulant at Patty&#8217;s continued
raillery.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then he shall have it! Rich as the Farringtons
are, if the son of the house wants a
penny of my fortune, it shall not be denied
him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty had risen, and was stalking up and down
the room with jerky strides, and dramatic waving
of her arms. Her golden hair hung in a
curly cloud over her blue silk kimono, and her
voice thrilled with a tragic intensity, though, of
course, exaggerated to a ludicrous degree.
</p>
<p>Having finished her speech, Patty retained her
dramatic pose, and glared at Elise like a very
young and pretty Lady Macbeth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Patty,&#8221; cried Elise, forgetting the subject
in hand, &#8220;you ought to be an actress! Do
you know, you were quite stunning when you
flung yourself round so. And, Patty, with
your voice,&mdash;your singing voice, I mean,&mdash;you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
ought to go on the stage! <i>Do</i>, will you, Patty?
I&#8217;d love to see you an opera singer!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Elise, you&#8217;re crazy to-night! Suppose I
should go on the stage, what would become of
all these devoted swains who are worshipping
my feetsteps?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bother the swains! Patty, my heart is set
upon it. You must be an actress. I mean a
really nice, gentle, refined one, like Maude
Adams, or Eleanor Robson. Oh, they are so
sweet! and such noble, grand women.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Elise, you have lovely ambitions for your
friends. What about yourself? Won&#8217;t you be
a circus-rider, dear? I want you to be as ambitious
for you as you are for me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty, stop your fooling. I was quite in
earnest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;d better begin fooling. It&#8217;s more
sensible than your earnestness. Now, I&#8217;m going
to run away to bed and leave you to dream that
you&#8217;re a circus-rider, whizzing round a ring on
a snow-white Arab steed. Good-night, girlie.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alone in her room, Patty smiled to herself at
Elise&#8217;s foolishness. And yet, though she had no
desire to be an actress, Patty had sometimes
dreamed of herself as a concert singer, enchanting
her audiences with her clear, sweet voice,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
which was fine and true, if not great. She was
ambitious, though as yet not definitely so, and
Elise&#8217;s words had roused a dormant desire to be
or to do something worth while, and not, as she
thought to herself, be a mere social butterfly.
</p>
<p>Then she smiled again as she thought of Elise&#8217;s
talk about Ken and Roger.
</p>
<p>But here no answering chord was touched. As
chums, she thoroughly liked both boys, but the
thought of any more serious liking only roused
a feeling of amusement in her mind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I may be glad to have somebody in
love with me some day,&#8221; she thought; &#8220;but it
will be many years from now, and meantime I
want to do a whole lot of things that are really
worth doing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then, with a whimsical thought that to sleep
was the thing most worth doing at the present
moment, Patty tumbled into the soft, white
nest prepared for her and was soon sound
asleep.
</p>
<p>Christmas Day was one of the finest. No
snow, but a clear, cold, bracing air, that was exhilarating
to breathe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Skating this afternoon?&#8221; said Roger, after
the Merry Christmas greetings had been exchanged.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed,&#8221; cried Patty and Elise in one
breath.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s get up a party, shall us?&#8221; went on
Roger, &#8220;and skate till dusk, and then all come
back here and have tea under the Christmas
tree?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lovely!&#8221; cried Elise, but Patty hesitated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know we have the dance on for to-night,&#8221;
she said.
</p>
<p>Patty was not robust, and continuous exertions
often tired her. Nan had cautioned her not to
attempt too much gaiety during this visit, and
she wanted to rest before the evening&#8217;s dance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, pshaw!&#8221; said Elise, &#8220;there&#8217;ll be lots
of time. The dance won&#8217;t begin till nine, anyway.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So Patty agreed, and Roger went off to invite
his skating party by telephone.
</p>
<p>He secured Kenneth, and the two Morses, and
then he hung up the receiver.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s enough,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like
a big skating party. Slip away, girls, and get
your bonnets and shawls; the car&#8217;ll be here in
half an hour.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girls went off to dress, and Patty viewed
her new skating costume with decided approval.
</p>
<p>It was all of white. A white cloth frock, with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
short skirt; white broadcloth coat and a Russian
turban of white cloth and fur; long white leather
leggings, and her Christmas furs, which
added a charming touch to the costume.
</p>
<p>As being more comfortable for skating, she had
returned to her former mode of hair-dressing,
and so two big white ribbon bows bloomed at
the back of her head. These, and the short
skirt, quite took away Patty&#8217;s grown-up air, and
made her seem a little girl again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Baby,&#8221; said Roger, as he saw her
come downstairs, with rosy cheeks and eyes
sparkling with pleasurable anticipation, for
Patty loved to skate.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mam-ma!&#8221; said Patty, putting her finger in
her mouth, and assuming a vacant, babyish
stare.
</p>
<p>Roger laughed at her foolishness, and then
Elise came along and they all went out to the
car.
</p>
<p>Elise&#8217;s suit was of crimson cloth, bordered with
dark fur, and as a consequence the two girls
together made a pretty picture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re such a comfort, Patty,&#8221; Elise said,
as they climbed into the big car. &#8220;You always
dress just right to harmonise with my clothes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure you do!&#8221; said Roger, looking at the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
two girls admiringly. &#8220;No fellow on the ice
will escort such beautiful ladies as I have in my
charge. Now, we&#8217;ll pick up Ken and the
Morses, and then make a dash for the Pole.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They reached the Park by three o&#8217;clock, so had
nearly two hours of skating before the dusk
fell.
</p>
<p>Patty was a superior skater, and so were most
of the others, for Roger had chosen his party
with care.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Skate with me, Patty, will you?&#8221; said Roger,
just at the same moment that Kenneth said, &#8220;Of
course you&#8217;ll skate with me, Patty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty looked at both boys with a comical smile.
&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she said; &#8220;but I always like to
pick out my own escort.&#8221; Then, turning to Clifford
Morse, she said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Skate with me, won&#8217;t you, Cliff? We&#8217;re a
good team.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are that!&#8221; he replied, greatly pleased, if
a little surprised at Patty&#8217;s invitation.
</p>
<p>Kenneth and Roger grinned at each other, and
then turned quickly to the other girls, who had
not heard the little parley.
</p>
<p>Of course Roger skated with Clementine
Morse, and Kenneth with Elise, which arrangement
quite satisfied the dark-eyed beauty.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You look like Little Red Riding-hood,&#8221; said
Kenneth, as they started off, with long, gliding
strokes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be a wolf, and eat me up,&#8221; laughed
Elise, for Kenneth had fur on his cap and overcoat,
and with his big fur gloves, seemed almost
like some big, good-natured animal.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You skate beautifully, Elise,&#8221; said Kenneth,
&#8220;and all you girls do. Look at Clementine;
isn&#8217;t she graceful?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Elise, &#8220;and so is Patty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty,&#8221; echoed Kenneth. &#8220;She is a poem on
ice!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was, and Elise knew it, but a naughty little
jealousy burned in her heart at Ken&#8217;s words.
</p>
<p>She bravely tried to down it, however, and
said: &#8220;Yes, she is. She&#8217;s a poem in every
way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know about that. In some
ways she&#8217;s more of a jolly, merry jingle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A nonsense rhyme,&#8221; suggested Elise, falling
in with his metaphor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; how quick you are to see what I mean.
Now, Clementine is a lyric,&mdash;she glides so
gracefully along.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I?&#8221; asked Elise, laughing at his witty
characterisation.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You? Well, I can&#8217;t judge unless I see you.
Skate off by yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Elise did so, and Kenneth watched the scarlet-clad
figure gracefully pirouetting and skilfully
executing difficult steps.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; she said, as she returned to him,
and again they joined hands and glided along in
unison.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re delightful on ice. You&#8217;re a
will o&#8217; the wisp.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I want to be a poem of some sort. The
other girls are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kenneth smiled at the pretty, anxious
face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a poem. You&#8217;re one of those little
French forms. A virelay or a triolet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Elise was a little uncertain as to what these
were, exactly, but she resolved to look them up
as soon as she reached home. At any rate, she
knew Kenneth meant to be complimentary, and
she smiled with pleasure.
</p>
<p>Then the others joined them and they all
skated together for a time, and then the sun set,
and Roger said they must go home.
</p>
<p>He was a most reliable boy, and always took
charge of their little expeditions or outings.
Elise never thought of questioning his authority,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
so again they all bundled into the car, and
started homeward.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I ought to go right home,&#8221; said Clementine.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, come round for a cup of Christmas tea,&#8221;
said Roger, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll take you home in half an
hour.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So the Morses consented, and the six merry
young people had tea under the Christmas tree,
and told stories by the firelight, and laughed and
chatted until Clementine declared she must
go, or she&#8217;d never get back in time for the
dance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to wear, Patsy?&#8221; asked
Elise, as they went upstairs, arm in arm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a new frock, of course. Did you think
I&#8217;d come to your dance in one I&#8217;d worn before?
Nay, I hold Miss Farrington in too high esteem
for that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, scurry into it, for I&#8217;m crazy to see it.
If it&#8217;s prettier than mine, I won&#8217;t let you go
down to the ballroom!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t be,&#8221; returned Patty; &#8220;don&#8217;t worry
about that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>But when the two girls were dressed, Patty&#8217;s
frock, though not so expensive, was quite as
attractive as Elise&#8217;s.
</p>
<p>Patty&#8217;s was of apricot-coloured satin, veiled all
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
over with a delicate thin material of the same
shade. A pearl trimming encircled the slightly
low-cut throat and the short sleeves. It was
very becoming to pretty Patty, and she knew
herself that she had never looked better.
</p>
<p>Elise&#8217;s gown was of white silk, draped with
silvered lace. It was lovely, and suited Elise&#8217;s
dark hair and eyes, and really both girls were
pictures. But Patty&#8217;s face was sunny and happy,
while Elise&#8217;s red mouth drooped in a little curve
of discontent.
</p>
<p>The girl was discontented by nature, and
though she had everything that heart could
wish, she was never brimming over with content
and happiness, as Patty always was.
</p>
<p>The dance was in the tennis court, where a
smooth crash had replaced the snowy floor of
the Christmas Eve celebration. The Christmas
tree still stood there, as it formed a beautiful
decoration for that end of the ballroom.
</p>
<p>It was not a large party, for Mrs. Farrington
would not allow Elise to act like a young lady
out in society. About thirty young people were
asked, and the hours were from nine till twelve.
</p>
<p>But the music was of the finest, and as Patty&#8217;s
favourite amusement was dancing, she had a
most enjoyable time.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></p>
<p>An exquisite dancer, she was, of course, besieged
by partners, but in her merry, wholehearted
way, she treated them all alike, showing
favouritism to none, and dancing with less desirable
partners as pleasantly and happily as
with those she liked better.
</p>
<p>Roger grumbled at this.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re wasted on a fellow like Harry Barr,&#8221;
he said, as he and Patty started for a turn. &#8220;He
dances like a grain-thresher, and yet you bob
along with him as smilingly as if you were dancing
with a decent tripper.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; returned Patty; &#8220;he&#8217;s pleasant
and kind. He doesn&#8217;t <i>talk</i> like a grain-thresher,
and he can&#8217;t help his dancing. Or rather, his
lack of it, for you can&#8217;t call those gymnastics of
his dancing. Oh, Roger, there&#8217;s Mr. Hepworth!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sure enough, Mr. Hepworth had just come in,
and as Patty spoke, he caught her eye and
smiled.
</p>
<p>She smiled back, and when the dance was over
asked Roger to take her to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Old Hepworth?&#8221; said Roger, in surprise.
&#8220;You can&#8217;t waste time on him, Patty; your
dance card is full, you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care, I must just speak to him. I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
haven&#8217;t seen him since I came home. Whoever
belongs to my next dance can wait a few minutes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right; come on, then.&#8221; Roger led her
across the room, and with a smiling face, and
in tones of glad welcome, she said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Hepworth, how do you do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty!&#8221; he exclaimed, taking her hands in
his. &#8220;I&#8217;m so glad to see you again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a thrill in his voice that startled
her, but she only said, &#8220;And so am I glad to
see you. Why haven&#8217;t you been to call on
me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve just returned from a Southern trip.
Only reached New York to-night,&mdash;and here I
am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here I am, too, but I can&#8217;t talk to you now.
My programme is full, and I make it a point always
to keep my engagements.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not one dance left?&#8221; said Mr. Hepworth,
looking over the scribbled card.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not one! I&#8217;m so sorry,&mdash;but, of course, I
didn&#8217;t know you were coming.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not. Run along now, and enjoy
yourself, and I&#8217;ll call on you, if I may, some
time when you are at home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, do,&#8221; said Patty, realising that Mr. Hepworth
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
was the same kind, thoughtful friend he
had always been.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder why I&#8217;m so glad to see him,&#8221; she
thought to herself, as she walked away with her
new partner; &#8220;but I am, all the same.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>A FAIR PROPOSITION</h3>
</div>

<p>It was on the afternoon of New Year&#8217;s Day
that Mr. Hepworth came to call on Patty.
She was at home again, having returned
from her visit to Elise a few days after Christmas.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know I am old-fashioned,&#8221; he said, as
he greeted the Fairfield family, and joined their
circle round the library fire. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t suppose
you thought I was quite so old-fashioned
as to make calls on New Year&#8217;s Day. However,
I&#8217;m not quite doing that, as this is the only call
I shall make to-day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re glad to see you any day in the year,&#8221;
said Nan, cordially, and Patty added:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed we are. I&#8217;ve been wondering why
you didn&#8217;t come round.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Busy,&#8221; said Mr. Hepworth, smiling at her.
&#8220;An artist&#8217;s life is not a leisure one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is anybody&#8217;s now-a-days?&#8221; asked Mr. Fairfield.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
&#8220;The tendency of the age is to rush and
hurry all the time. What a contrast to a hundred
years ago!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And a good contrast, too,&#8221; declared Nan.
&#8220;If the world still jogged along at a hundred
years ago rate, we would have no motor-cars, no
aëroplanes, no&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No North Pole,&#8221; suggested her husband.
&#8220;True enough, Nan, to accomplish things we
must be busy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to get busy,&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;No, I
don&#8217;t mean that for slang,&#8221;&mdash;as her father
looked at her reprovingly,&mdash;&#8220;but I want to do
something that is really worth while.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The usual ambition of extreme youth,&#8221; said
Mr. Hepworth, looking at her kindly, if quizzically.
&#8220;Do you want to reform the world, and
in what way?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not exactly reform it,&#8221; said Patty, smiling
back at him; &#8220;reform has such a serious sound.
But I do want to make it brighter and
better.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good phrase, too,&#8221; observed Mr.
Hepworth, still teasingly. &#8220;But, Patty, you do
make the world brighter and better, just by being
in it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s too easy; and, anyway, I expect to remain
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
in it for some several years yet; and I want
to do something beside just <i>be</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, well, you can doubtless find some outlet
for your enthusiasms.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What she really wants,&#8221; said her father, &#8220;is
to be an operatic star.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And sing into phonographs,&#8221; added Nan,
mischievously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; smiled Patty, &#8220;and have my picture
in the backs of magazines!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; said Mr. Hepworth, &#8220;aim
high, while you&#8217;re about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can aim high enough,&#8221; returned Patty,
&#8220;but I&#8217;m not sure I can sing high enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you only need to come high enough, to
be an operatic star,&#8221; said Mr. Hepworth, who
was in merry mood to-day.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, seriously,&#8221; said Patty, who was in
earnest mood, &#8220;I do want to do good. I don&#8217;t
mean in a public way, but in a charity way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, soup-kitchens and bread-lines?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; not exactly. I mean to help people who
have no sweetness and light in their lives.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Patty,&#8221; groaned Nan, &#8220;if you&#8217;re on that
tack, you&#8217;re hopeless. What have you been
reading? &#8216;The Young Maiden&#8217;s Own Ruskin,&#8217;
or &#8216;Look Up and Not Down&#8217;?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And lend a ten,&#8221; supplemented Mr. Fairfield.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t laugh,&#8221; began Patty, pouting a
little. Then she laughed herself, and went on:
&#8220;Yes, you may laugh if you want to,&mdash;I know I
sound ridiculous. But I tell you, people, I&#8217;m
going to make good!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You may make good,&#8221; said her father, &#8220;but
you&#8217;ll never be good until you stop using slang.
How often, my daughter, have I told you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, cut it out, daddy,&#8221; said Patty, dimpling
with laughter, for she knew her occasional slang
phrases amused her father, even though they annoyed
him. &#8220;If you&#8217;ll help me &#8216;do noble
things, not dream them all day long,&#8217; I&#8217;ll promise
to talk only in purest English undefiled.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness, Patty!&#8221; said Nan, &#8220;you&#8217;re a
walking cyclopædia of poetical quotations to-day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re a running commentary on them,&#8221;
returned Patty, promptly, which remark sent
Mr. Hepworth off in peals of laughter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Patty!&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid
you&#8217;re going to grow up clever! That would be
fatal to your ambition! Be good, sweet child,
and let who will be clever. Nobody can be
both.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I can,&#8221; declared Patty; &#8220;I&#8217;ll show you Missouri
people yet!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Fairfield groaned at this new burst of
slang, but Mr. Hepworth only laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll get over it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A few years of
these &#8216;noble aims&#8217; of hers will make her so
serious-minded that she won&#8217;t even see the
meaning of a slang phrase. Though, I must
admit, I think some of them very apt, myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They sure are!&#8221; said irrepressible Patty,
giggling at her father&#8217;s frown.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ll tell you one thing,&#8221; went on Mr.
Hepworth: &#8220;Whatever line you decide upon,
let it be something that needs no training. I
mean, if you choose to go in for organised charity
or settlement work, well and good. But
don&#8217;t attempt Red Cross nursing or kindergarten
teaching, or anything that requires technical
knowledge. For in these days, only trained
labour succeeds, and only expert, at that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, pshaw,&#8221; said Patty; &#8220;I don&#8217;t mean to
earn money. Though if I wanted to, I&#8217;m sure
I could. Why, if I <i>had</i> to earn my own living,
I could do it as easy as anything!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure of that,&#8221; said Mr. Hepworth,
gravely. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t so easy for a young woman
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
to earn her living without a technical education
in some line.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Patty, you&#8217;ll never have to earn your
own living,&#8221; said her father, smiling; &#8220;so don&#8217;t
worry about that. But I agree with our friend,
that you couldn&#8217;t do it, if you did have to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds so Irish, daddy, that I think it&#8217;s
as bad as slang. However, I see you are all of
unsympathetic nature, so I won&#8217;t confide in you
further as to my aims or ambitions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t noticed any confidences yet,&#8221; murmured
Nan; &#8220;only appeals for help.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty gave her a withering glance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The subject is dropped,&#8221; she said; &#8220;let us
now talk about the weather.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Hepworth; &#8220;let me tell you a
story. Let me tell you of a girl I met down
South, who, if she only had Patty&#8217;s determination
and force of character, might achieve success,
and even renown.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do tell us about her,&#8221; said Nan, for Mr.
Hepworth was always an interesting talker.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She lives in Virginia, and her name is Christine
Farley. A friend of mine, down there,
asked me to look at some of her drawings, and
I saw at once that the girl has real talent, if not
genius.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you would know,&#8221; said Nan, for
Mr. Hepworth himself was a portrait painter
of high repute.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, she really has done some remarkable
work. But she is poor and lives in a small
country town. She has already learned all the
local teachers can give her, and needs the technical
training of a good art school. With a year
of such training she could easily become, I am
sure, a successful illustrator. At least, after a
year&#8217;s study, I know she could get good work
to do, and then she would rapidly become
known.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t she manage to do this, in some way?&#8221;
asked Mr. Fairfield.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; she is ambitious in her work, but in
no other way. She is shy and timid; a country
girl, inexperienced in the ways of the world,
ignorant of city life, and desperately afraid of
New York, which to her is a name for all unknown
terrors.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Goose!&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m sorry for
her, of course; but as an American girl, she
ought to have more spunk.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Southern girls don&#8217;t have spunk, Patty,&#8221;
said her father, with a merry twinkle in his
eye.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t they! Well, I guess I ought to know!
I&#8217;m a Southern girl, myself. At least, I was
until I was fourteen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you&#8217;ve achieved your spunk since
you came North, then,&#8221; said Hepworth; &#8220;for I
agree with your father, Southern girls do not
have much energy of character. At least, Miss
Farley hasn&#8217;t. She&#8217;s about nineteen or twenty,
but she&#8217;s as childish as a girl of fourteen,&mdash;except
in her work; there she excels any one of her
age I&#8217;ve ever known.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can nothing be done in the matter?&#8221; asked
Nan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m told they&#8217;re very proud
people, and would not accept charity. Of course
she never can earn anything by her work if she
stays at home; and as she can&#8217;t get away, it
seems to be a deadlock.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to help her,&#8221; said Patty, slowly. &#8220;I
do think she ought to have ingenuity enough to
help herself, but if she hasn&#8217;t, I&#8217;d like to help
her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How can you?&#8221; asked Nan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. But the way to find out how
to do things is to do them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear,&#8221; moaned Mr. Hepworth, in mock
despair. &#8220;I said I feared you were clever.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
Don&#8217;t say those things, Patty, you&#8217;ll ruin your
reputation as a beauty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh!&#8221; said Patty, who sometimes didn&#8217;t
know whether Mr. Hepworth was teasing her
or not, &#8220;that isn&#8217;t a clever thing to say.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if you don&#8217;t mean it for an epigram,
I&#8217;ll forgive you,&mdash;but don&#8217;t let it happen again.
Now, as to Christine Farley. I&#8217;ll let you be
clever for once, if you&#8217;ll turn your cleverness to
devising some way to aid her to an art education.
Can you think of any way?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can think of dozens,&#8221; returned Patty, &#8220;but
the only thing to do is for her to come to New
York, get a scholarship at the Art School, and
then board in a hall bedroom,&mdash;art students always
do that,&mdash;and they have jolly good times
with chafing dishes and palette knives, and such
things. I&#8217;ve read about &#8217;em.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mr. Hepworth, &#8220;but how is she
to pay the board for the hall bedroom? They
are really quite poor, I&#8217;m told.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; said Patty, scornfully, &#8220;anybody,&mdash;the
merest infant,&mdash;could earn enough money
outside class hours to pay a small sum like that,
I should hope! Why, how much would such
board cost?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty, child,&#8221; said her father, &#8220;you don&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
know much of social economics, do you? I
fancy the young woman could board properly
for about twelve or fifteen dollars a week; eh,
Hepworth?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I daresay fifteen dollars a week would
cover her expenses, including her art materials.
Of course this would mean literally the
&#8216;hall bedroom&#8217; in a very modest boarding-house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; went on Patty, &#8220;and do you mean
to say that this girl couldn&#8217;t earn fifteen dollars
a week, and attend her classes, too?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean to say just that,&#8221; said Mr. Hepworth,
seriously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I agree with you,&#8221; said Nan. &#8220;Why, I
couldn&#8217;t earn fifteen dollars a week, and stay at
home from the classes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Nan!&#8221; cried Patty, &#8220;you could! I&#8217;m
sure you could! Why, I&#8217;ll bet I could earn fifteen
dollars a week, and have plenty of time left
for my practising, my club meetings, motoring,
skating, and all the things I want to do beside.
Fifteen dollars a week is <i>nothing</i>!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gently, gently, my girl,&#8221; said her father, for
Patty&#8217;s cheeks were pink with the earnestness of
her argument. &#8220;Fifteen dollars a week seems
nothing to you, because you have all the money
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
you want. But where is your sense of proportion?
Your idea of relative values? The value
of fifteen dollars handed out to you willingly by
a loving father, or the value of fifteen dollars
earned from a grudging employer, are totally
different matters.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;I know I could
earn that much a week, and I believe this other
girl could do so, if she had somebody to make
her think she could.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a good deal in that,&#8221; said Hepworth,
thoughtfully. &#8220;Miss Farley does need somebody
to make her think she can do things. But
the life of an art student is a busy one, and I&#8217;m
sure she couldn&#8217;t earn much money while she&#8217;s
studying.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But fifteen dollars a week isn&#8217;t much,&#8221; persisted
Patty. &#8220;Anybody could earn that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, Puss,&#8221; said her father: &#8220;sometimes
you show a bravery of assertion that ought
to be put to the test. Now I&#8217;ll make a proposition
to you in the presence of these two witnesses.
If you&#8217;ll earn fifteen dollars in one
week,&mdash;any week,&mdash;I&#8217;ll agree to pay the board
of this Miss Farley in New York, for a year,
while she pursues her art studies.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, father, will you?&#8221; cried Patty. &#8220;What
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
a duck you are! Of course I can earn the
money, easily.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a moment; there are conditions, or
rather stipulations. You must not do anything
unbecoming a quiet, refined girl,&mdash;but I know
you wouldn&#8217;t do that, anyway. You must not
engage in any pursuit that keeps you away from
your home after five o&#8217;clock in the afternoon&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; interrupted Patty, &#8220;I don&#8217;t propose to
go out washing! I shall do light work of some
sort at home. But never you mind what I do,&mdash;of
course it will be nothing you could possibly
object to,&mdash;I&#8217;ll earn fifteen dollars in less than
a week.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A week, though, is the proposition. When
you bring me fifteen dollars, earned by yourself,
unassisted, in the space of seven days, I&#8217;ll carry
out my part of the bargain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the girl won&#8217;t accept it,&#8221; said Patty, regretfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m trusting to your tact, and Nan&#8217;s, to offer
the opportunity to her in such a way that she
will accept it. Couldn&#8217;t that be done, Hepworth?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes; I daresay it could be managed.
And you are very generous, Mr. Fairfield, but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
I can&#8217;t say I have much hope of Patty&#8217;s success.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Patty&#8217;s success&#8217; is always a foregone conclusion,&#8221;
said that young woman, saucily; &#8220;and
now, at last, I have an aim in life! I shall begin
to-morrow,&mdash;and we&#8217;ll see!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The others laughed, for no one could take
pretty Patty very seriously, except herself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t tell anybody,&#8221; she added, as the
doorbell rang.
</p>
<p>They all promised they wouldn&#8217;t, and then
Elise and Roger came in to bring New Year&#8217;s
greetings, and the conversation took a lighter
and merrier turn.

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>DEPARTMENT G</h3>
</div>

<p>Alone in her own room that same night,
Patty thought out her great project.
She was not at all doubtful of her success,
she was only choosing among the various
methods of earning money that occurred to her.
</p>
<p>All were easy, and some of them even seemed
delightful occupations.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Father is an angel,&#8221; she thought to herself;
&#8220;a big, splendid angel. He knew I could do
my part easily enough, and he only made it a
stipulation because he didn&#8217;t want to shoulder
the whole affair outright. He wanted me to
feel I had a hand in it. He&#8217;s so tactful and
dear. Well, I&#8217;ll do my part so well, he&#8217;ll have
nothing to complain of. Then I&#8217;ll get Nan to
write to the girl, and invite her here for a few
days or a week. Then I rather guess we can
gently persuade her to accept the goods the gods
provide.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></p>
<p>Considering the matter as settled, Patty went
to sleep and dreamed happily of her coming
triumphs as a wage-earner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you go to business to-day, Miss Fairfield?&#8221;
asked her father, at the breakfast table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Fairfield. That is, I shall occupy
myself with my&mdash;with my occupation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed! that is logical, at any rate. Would
it be indiscreet to inquire the nature of said occupation?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be not only indiscreet, but useless,
for I decline to tell. But it is work I shall do
at home. I&#8217;ve no desire to enter an office. And,
you don&#8217;t need a stenographer, anyway, do
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, and if I did, I shouldn&#8217;t take you.
You&#8217;re too young and too self-assured,&mdash;not desirable
traits in office work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I may get over them both,&#8221; said Patty, smiling
at him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You probably will,&#8221; said Nan, &#8220;before
you&#8217;ve succeeded in this ridiculous scheme you&#8217;ve
undertaken.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Nannikins, don&#8217;t desert Mr. Micawber
in that cruel fashion,&#8221; Patty flung back,
gaily; &#8220;the game&#8217;s never out till it&#8217;s played out,
you know; and this game isn&#8217;t even yet begun.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be played out before the game is,&#8221;
said her father.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, daddy, I&#8217;m &#8217;fraid that&#8217;s slang! I am
truly &#8217;fraid so!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, mind now, Puss; you&#8217;re not to tire
yourself too much. Remember when you &#8217;most
worked yourself to death, at your Commencement
celebration.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but I&#8217;ve had a lot of experience since
that. And I&#8217;m much weller and stronger.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you&#8217;re well; but you&#8217;re not of a very
strong constitution, and never will be. So remember,
and don&#8217;t overdo.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not I. I can earn fifteen dollars a week, and
more too, I know, without overdoing myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by, then; I must be off. I&#8217;ll hear to-night
the report of your first day&#8217;s work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The family separated, and Patty ran singing
away to make her preparations for the campaign.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What <i>are</i> you doing?&#8221; asked Nan, as she
went rummaging in the linen closet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing naughty,&#8221; replied Patty, giggling.
&#8220;Curb your curiosity, stepmothery, for it won&#8217;t
be gratified.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nan laughed and went away, and Patty proceeded
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
to select certain very pretty embroidered
doilies and centrepieces,&mdash;two of each.
</p>
<p>These she laid carefully in a flat box, which
she tied up into a neat parcel. Then she put
on her plainest cloth suit, and a small, dark
hat, and was ready to start.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nan,&#8221; she said, looking in at the library
door, &#8220;what time do you want the motor?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, about eleven or twelve. Keep it as long
as you like.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only ten now. I&#8217;ll be back in less than
an hour, I&#8217;m sure. Good-by.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by,&#8221; returned Nan. &#8220;Good luck to
you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She thought Patty&#8217;s scheme ridiculous, but
harmless, for she knew the girl well enough to
know she wouldn&#8217;t do anything that might lead
her into an unpleasant position; but she feared
that her boundless enthusiasm would urge her
on beyond the bounds of her nervous strength.
</p>
<p>Though soundly healthy, Patty was high-strung,
and stopped at no amount of exertion to
attain a desired end. More than once this
nervous energy of hers had caused physical collapse,
which was what Nan feared for her now.
</p>
<p>But Patty feared nothing for herself, and going
out to the waiting motor-car, she gave the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
chauffeur an address down in the lower part of
Broadway.
</p>
<p>It was so unusual, that Miller hesitated a moment
and then said, deferentially: &#8220;This is
&#8217;way downtown, Miss Patty; are you sure the
number is right?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; that&#8217;s all right,&#8221; she returned, smiling;
&#8220;go ahead.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So he went ahead, and after a long ride southward,
the car stopped in the crowded mercantile
portion of lower Broadway.
</p>
<p>Patty got out, and looked a little apprehensively
at the unfamiliar surroundings. &#8220;Wait
for me,&#8221; she said to Miller, and then turned determinedly
to the door.
</p>
<p>Yes, the number was right. There was the
sign, &#8220;Monongahela Art Embroidery Company,&#8221;
on the window. Patty opened the big
door, and went in.
</p>
<p>She had fancied it would be like the shops to
which she was accustomed, where polite floor-walkers
stepped up and asked her wishes, but it
was not at all like that.
</p>
<p>It was more like a large warehouse. Partitions
that rose only part way to the ceiling divided
off small rooms or departments, all of
which were piled high with boxes or crates. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
aisles between these were narrow, and the whole
place was rather dark. Moreover, there seemed
to be nobody about.
</p>
<p>Patty sat down in a chair and waited a few
moments, but no one appeared, so she got up
again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s where I need my pluck,&#8221; she said to
herself, not frightened, but wondering at the
situation. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go ahead, but I feel like Alice
in Wonderland. I know I&#8217;ll fall into a treacle
well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She traversed half the length of the long building,
when she saw a man, writing in one of the
small compartments.
</p>
<p>He looked up at her, and then, apparently
without interest in her presence there, resumed
his work.
</p>
<p>Patty was a little annoyed at what she thought
discourtesy, and said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come to answer your advertisement.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fourth floor,&#8221; said the man, indicating the
direction by pointing his penholder across the
room, but not looking up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Patty, in a tone intended to
rebuke his own lack of manners.
</p>
<p>But he only went on writing, and she turned
to look for the elevator.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></p>
<p>She could see none, however, so she walked on,
thinking how like a maze was this succession of
small rooms and little cross aisles. When she
saw another man writing in another coop, she
said politely:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you please direct me to the elevator?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; said the man, looking at her.
</p>
<p>Patty repeated her request.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t none,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Want work?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Though unpolished, he was not rude, and after
a moment&#8217;s hesitation, Patty said, &#8220;Yes, I
do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have to hoof it, then. Three flights up;
Department G.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Patty, whose spirits always
rose when she encountered difficulties. She saw
the staircase, now; a rough, wooden structure of
unplaned boards, and no balusters. But she
trudged up the long flight hopefully.
</p>
<p>The next floor seemed to be full of whirring
looms, and the noise was, as Patty described it
afterward, like the buzzing of a billion bees!
But, asking no further directions, she ascended
the next staircase and the next, until she found
herself on the fourth floor.
</p>
<p>Several people were bustling about here, all
seeming to be very busy and preoccupied.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Department G?&#8221; she inquired of a
man hurrying by.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask at the desk,&#8221; he replied, without pausing.
</p>
<p>This was ambiguous, as there were more than
a score of desks about, each tenanted by a busy
man, more often than not accompanied by a
stenographer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear, what a place!&#8221; thought Patty.
No one would attend to her wants; no one
seemed to notice her. She believed she could
stand there all day if she chose, without being
spoken to.
</p>
<p>Clearly, she must take the initiative.
</p>
<p>She saw a pleasant-faced woman at a desk, and
decided to address her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Department G, please?&#8221; she
asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;G?&#8221; said the woman, looking blank.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, G. The man downstairs told me it was
on the fourth floor. Isn&#8217;t this the fourth floor?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, where is Department G?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;G?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, <i>G</i>!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who does know?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The absurdity of this conversation made Patty
smile, which seemed to irritate the other.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help it if I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she snapped
out. &#8220;I&#8217;m new here, myself; only came yesterday.
I don&#8217;t know where G is, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; said Patty, sorry that she had
smiled, and she turned away.
</p>
<p>She caught a red-headed boy, as he passed,
whistling, and said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do <i>you</i> know where Department G is?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; said the boy, grinning at her.
&#8220;Sashay straight acrost de room. Pipe de guy
wit&#8217; de goggles?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Patty, restraining her desire
to smile at the funny little chap.
</p>
<p>She went over to the desk indicated. The man
seated there looked at her over his glasses, and
said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;To embroider?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Patty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Take a chair. Wait a few moments. I&#8217;m
busy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Relieved at having reached her goal, Patty sat
down in the chair indicated and waited. She
waited five minutes and then ten, and then fifteen.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span></p>
<p>The man was busy; there was no doubt of
that. He dashed off memoranda, gave them to
messengers, telephoned, whisked drawers open
and shut, and seemed to be in a very whirl of
business.
</p>
<p>As there was no indication of a cessation,
Patty grew impatient, at last, and said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you attend to my business soon? If not,
I&#8217;ll call some other day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the man, passing his hand across
his brow a little wearily. He looked tired, and
overworked, and Patty felt sorry for him.
</p>
<p>But he whirled round in his office chair and
asked her quite civilly what she wanted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You advertised for embroiderers,&#8221; began
Patty, feeling rather small and worthless, &#8220;so
I came&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; said the man, as she paused. &#8220;Can
you embroider? We use only the best. Have
you samples of your work?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have,&#8221; said Patty, beginning to untie her
box.
</p>
<p>But her fingers trembled, and she couldn&#8217;t unknot
the cord.
</p>
<p>The man took it from her, not rudely, but as
if every moment were precious. Deftly he
opened the parcel, and gave a quick glance at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
Patty&#8217;s exquisite needlework on the doilies and
centrepieces she had brought.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do it yourself?&#8221; he asked, already closing
the box again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, of course,&#8221; said Patty, indignant at the
implication.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No offence; that&#8217;s all right. Your work goes.
Report at Department B. Good-day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He handed her the box, whirled round to his
desk, and was immediately at his work again.
</p>
<p>Patty realised she was dismissed, and, taking
her box, she started for the stairs.
</p>
<p>She passed the red-headed boy again, and feeling
almost as if she were meeting an old friend
in a strange land, she said: &#8220;Where is Department
B?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Caught on, didjer?&#8221; he grinned. &#8220;Good
fer youse! B, first floor,&mdash;that way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He pointed a grimy finger in the direction she
should take, and went on, whistling. Down the
three flights of stairs went Patty, and thanks to
the clarity of the red-headed one&#8217;s direction, she
soon found Department B.
</p>
<p>This was in charge of a sharp-faced woman,
rather past middle age.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sent by Mr. Myers?&#8221; she inquired, looking
at Patty coldly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I was sent by the man in Department G,&#8221; returned
Patty. &#8220;He said my work would do,
and that I was to report to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right; how much do you want?&#8221; said
the woman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How much do you pay?&#8221; returned Patty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be impertinent, miss! I mean how
much work do you want?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Patty, who was quite innocent of
any intent to offend. &#8220;Why, I want enough to
last a week.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that depends on how fast you work,&#8221;
said the woman, speaking with some asperity.
&#8220;Come now, do you want a dozen, or two
dozen, or what?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty was strongly tempted to say: &#8220;What,
thank you!&#8221; but she refrained, knowing it was
no occasion for foolery.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know till I see them,&#8221; she replied.
&#8220;Are they elaborate pieces?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here they are,&#8221; said the woman, taking some
pieces of work from a box. Her tone seemed
to imply that she was conferring an enormous
favour on Patty by showing them.
</p>
<p>They were rather large centrepieces, all of the
same pattern, which was stamped, but not embroidered.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of work on those,&#8221; remarked
Patty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you <i>are</i> green!&#8221; said the woman. She
jerked out another similar centrepiece, on which
a small section, perhaps one-eighth of the whole,
was worked in silks.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is what you&#8217;re to do,&#8221; she explained, in
a tired, cross voice. &#8220;You work this corner,
and that&#8217;s all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who works the rest?&#8221; asked Patty, amazed
at this plan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, the buyer. We sell these to the shops;
they sell them to people who use this finished
corner as a guide to do the rest of the piece.
Can&#8217;t you understand?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I can, now that you explain it,&#8221; returned
Patty. &#8220;Then if I take a dozen, I&#8217;m to
work just that little corner on each one; is that
it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; said the woman, wearily, as if she
were making the explanation for the thousandth
time,&mdash;as she probably was.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can take this as a guide for yourself,&#8221;
she went on, a little more kindly, &#8220;and here&#8217;s
the silks. Did you say a dozen?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a minute,&#8221; said Patty; &#8220;how much do
you pay?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Five dollars.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Apiece, I suppose. Yes, I&#8217;ll take a dozen.&#8221;
The woman gave a hard little laugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Five dollars apiece!&#8221; she said. &#8220;Not much!
We pay five dollars a dozen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A dozen? Five dollars for all that work!
Why, each of those corners is as much work as
a whole doily.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, just about; do you work fast?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; pretty fast.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty was doing some mental calculation.
Three dozen of those pieces meant an interminable
lot of work. But it also meant fifteen dollars,
and Patty&#8217;s spirit was now fully roused.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take three dozen,&#8221; she said, decidedly;
&#8220;and I&#8217;ll bring them back, finished, a week from
to-day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My, you must be a swift worker,&#8221; said the
woman, in a disinterested voice.
</p>
<p>She was already sorting out silks, as with a
practised hand, and making all into a parcel.
</p>
<p>Patty was about to offer her a visiting card, as
she assumed she must give her address, when the
woman said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eighteen dollars, please.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;What for?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Security. You don&#8217;t suppose we let everybody
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
walk off with our materials, and never
come back, do you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you doubt my honesty?&#8221; said Patty,
haughtily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t doubt anybody&#8217;s honesty,&#8221; was the
reply. &#8220;Some folks don&#8217;t have any to doubt.
But it&#8217;s the rule of the house. Six dollars a
dozen is the deposit price for that pattern.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But eighteen dollars is more than you&#8217;re
going to pay me for the work,&#8221; said Patty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the woman, &#8220;but can&#8217;t you understand?
This is a deposit to protect ourselves
if you never return, or if you spoil the work. If
you bring it back in satisfactory condition, at the
appointed time, we return your deposit, and pay
you the price agreed upon for the work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I see,&#8221; said Patty, taking out her purse.
&#8220;And it does seem fair. But isn&#8217;t it hard for
poor girls to put up that deposit?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is.&#8221; The woman&#8217;s face softened a
little. &#8220;But they get it back,&mdash;if they do the
work right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And suppose I bring it back unfinished, or
only part done?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If what you do is done right, you&#8217;ll get paid.
And if the pieces you don&#8217;t do are unsoiled and
in good condition, we redeem them. But if you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
care for steady work here, you&#8217;d better not take
more&#8217;n you can accomplish.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Patty, slowly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll keep
the three dozen. Good-morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-day,&#8221; said the woman, curtly, and
turned away with a tired sigh.
</p>
<p>Patty went out to the street, and found Miller
looking exceedingly anxious about the prolonged
absence of his young mistress.
</p>
<p>A look of relief overspread his face as she appeared,
and when she got into the car and said:
&#8220;Home, Miller,&#8221; he started with an air of decided
satisfaction.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>EMBROIDERED BLOSSOMS</h3>
</div>

<p>It was after twelve o&#8217;clock when Patty
reached home, and she found Nan, with her
wraps on, rather anxiously awaiting her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty! Wherever have you been all this
time?&#8221; she cried, as Patty came in with her big
bundle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Laying the foundations of my great career;
and, oh, Nan, it was pretty awful! I&#8217;m in for
it, I can tell you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What a goose you are!&#8221; But Nan smiled
affectionately at the rosy, excited face of her
stepdaughter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going out on a short errand, Patty.
I&#8217;ll be home to luncheon at one, and then you
must tell me all about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty ran up to her own room, and, flinging
off her hat and coat, sat down to open her
bundle of work.
</p>
<p>It was appalling. The portion to be embroidered
looked larger than it had done in the shop,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
and the pattern was one of the most intricate and
elaborate she had ever seen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank goodness, they&#8217;re all alike,&#8221; thought
poor Patty. &#8220;After I do one, the others will be
easier.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She flew for her embroidery hoops and work-basket,
and began at once on one of the centrepieces.
</p>
<p>The pattern was a floral design, tied with bow-knots
and interlaced with a conventional lattice-work.
The shading of the blossoms was complicated,
and showed many shades of each colour.
The bow-knots were of a solid colour, but
required close, fine stitches of a tedious nature,
while the lattice-work part seemed to present
an interminable task.
</p>
<p>Patty was a skilful embroiderer, and realised
at her first glance that she had a fearful amount
of work before her.
</p>
<p>But as yet she was undismayed, and cheerfully
started in on the flowers.
</p>
<p>She selected the right silks, cut the skeins
neatly, and put them in thread papers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For,&#8221; she thought, &#8220;if I allow my silks to
get tangled or mixed up, it will delay me, of
course.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At one o&#8217;clock, Nan came to her room.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you hear the luncheon gong?&#8221; she
said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Patty, looking up. &#8220;Is it one
o&#8217;clock already?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For goodness&#8217;, gracious&#8217; sake, Patty! What
<i>are</i> you doing? Is <i>that</i> your &#8216;occupation&#8217;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Patty, proudly displaying a wild
rose, beautifully worked, and carefully tinted.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t I do it nicely?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed you do! Your embroidery is always
exquisite. But are you going to work that whole
centrepiece?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, only a section,&mdash;see, just this much.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty indicated the portion she was to work,
but she didn&#8217;t say that she had thirty-five more,
carefully laid away in a box, to do within the
week.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; agreed Nan, &#8220;that&#8217;s not such a terrific
task. But will they give you fifteen dollars
for that piece?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Patty, smiling a little grimly; &#8220;but
there are others.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oho! A lot of them! A dozen, I suppose.
They always give out work by dozens.
Well, girlie, I don&#8217;t want to be discouraging,
but you can&#8217;t do a dozen in a week. Come on
down to luncheon.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></p>
<p>At the table, Patty gave Nan a graphic description
of her morning&#8217;s experiences.
</p>
<p>Though more or less shocked at the whole performance,
Nan couldn&#8217;t help laughing at Patty&#8217;s
dramatic recital, and the way in which she mimicked
the various people.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet, Nan,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it&#8217;s really pathetic;
they all seemed so busy and so tired. The
woman who gave me the work was like a machine,&mdash;as
if she just fed out centrepieces to
people who came for them. I&#8217;m sure she hasn&#8217;t
smiled for fourteen years. The only gay one
in the place was the red-headed boy; and he
talked such fearful slang it cured me of ever
using it again! Father will be glad of that,
anyway. Hereafter I shall converse in Henry
James diction. Why, Nan, he said, &#8216;Pipe de
guy wit&#8217; de goggles&#8217;!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did he mean?&#8221; asked Nan, puzzled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he meant, &#8216;observe the gentleman wearing
spectacles.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you know?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Intuition, I suppose. And then, he pointed
to the man in question.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty, you&#8217;ll get more slangy still, if you go
among such people.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I won&#8217;t. There&#8217;s no cure like an awful
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
example. Watch the elegance of my conversation
from now on. And besides, Nan, you
mustn&#8217;t act as if I associated with them socially.
I assure you I was quite the haughty lady. But
that slangy boy was an angel unawares. I&#8217;d
probably be there yet but for his kindly
aid.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose you&#8217;ll have to carry this absurd
scheme through. And, Patty, I&#8217;ll help you
in any way I can. Don&#8217;t you want me to wind
silks, or something?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, ducky stepmother of mine. The only
way you can help is to head off callers. I can do
the work if I can keep at it. But if the girls
come bothering round, I&#8217;ll never get it done.
Now, this afternoon, I want to do a lot, so if
any one asks for me, won&#8217;t you gently but firmly
refuse to let them see me? Make yourself so
entertaining that they&#8217;ll forget my existence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try,&#8221; said Nan, dubiously; &#8220;but if it&#8217;s
Elise or Clementine, they&#8217;ll insist on seeing
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let &#8217;em insist. Tell &#8217;em I have a sick headache,&mdash;for
I feel sure I shall before the afternoon&#8217;s
over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Patty, I won&#8217;t have that sort of thing!
You may work an hour or so, then you must
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
rest, or go for a drive, or chat with the girls,
or something.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will, other days, Nan. But to-day I want
to put in the solid afternoon working, so I&#8217;ll
know how much I can accomplish.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you really a dozen of those things to
do, Patty?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I have.&#8221; Patty didn&#8217;t dare say she had
three dozen. &#8220;And if I do well this afternoon,
I can calculate how long the work will take.
Oh, Nan, I do want to succeed. It isn&#8217;t only
the work, you know, it&#8217;s the principle. I hate
to be baffled; and I <i>won&#8217;t</i> be!&#8221;
</p>
<p>A stubborn look came into Patty&#8217;s pretty
eyes,&mdash;a look which Nan knew well. A look
which meant that the indomitable will might be
broken but not bent, and that Patty would persevere
in her chosen course until she conquered or
was herself defeated.
</p>
<p>So, after luncheon, she returned to her task, a
little less certain of success than she had been,
but no less persevering.
</p>
<p>The work was agreeable to her. She loved
to embroider, and the dainty design and exquisite
colouring appealed to her æsthetic
sense.
</p>
<p>Had it been only one centrepiece, and had she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
not felt hurried, it would have been a happy
outlook.
</p>
<p>But as she carefully matched the shades of
silk to the sample piece, she found that it took
a great deal of time to get the tints exactly
right.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s only for the first one,&#8221; she
thought hopefully; &#8220;for all the others, I shall
know just which silks to use. I&#8217;ll lay them in
order, so there&#8217;ll be no doubt about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her habits of method and system stood her in
good stead now, and her skeins, carefully
marked, were laid in order on her little work-table.
</p>
<p>But though her fingers fairly flew, the pattern
progressed slowly. She even allowed herself
to leave long stitches on the wrong side,&mdash;a
thing she never did in her own embroidery. She
tried to do all the petals of one tint at once, to
avoid delay of changing the silks. She used
every effort to make &#8220;her head save her hands,&#8221;
but the result was that both head and hands became
heated and nervous.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This won&#8217;t do,&#8221; she said to herself, as the
silk frazzled between her trembling fingers.
&#8220;If I get nervous, I&#8217;ll never accomplish anything!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></p>
<p>She forced herself to be calm, and to move
more slowly, but the mental strain of hurry,
and the physical strain of eyes and muscles,
made her jerky, and the stitches began to be
less true and correct.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be sensible,&#8221; she thought; &#8220;I&#8217;ll take ten
minutes off and relax.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She went downstairs, singing, and trying to
assume a careless demeanour.
</p>
<p>Going into Nan&#8217;s sitting-room, she said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Work&#8217;s going on finely. I came down for a
glass of water, and to rest a minute. Any one
been here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Nan, pleasantly, pretending not
to notice Patty&#8217;s flushed cheeks and tired eyes.
Really, she had several times stolen on tiptoe
to Patty&#8217;s door, and anxiously looked at her
bending over her work. But Patty didn&#8217;t know
this, and wise Nan concluded the time to speak
was not yet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no one came in to disturb you, which is
fortunate. You&#8217;re sensible, dear, to rest a bit.
Jane will bring you some water. Polly want a
cracker?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thank you; I&#8217;m not hungry. Nan,
that&#8217;s awfully fine work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know it, Patsy. But remember, you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
don&#8217;t <i>have</i> to do it. Give the thing a fair trial,
and if it doesn&#8217;t go easily, give it up and try
something else.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It goes easily enough; it isn&#8217;t that. But you
know yourself, you can&#8217;t do really good embroidery
if you do it too rapidly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Deed you can&#8217;t! But you do such wonderfully
perfect work, that I should think you
could afford to slight it a little, and still have it
better than other people&#8217;s.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nan, you&#8217;re such a comfort!&#8221; cried Patty,
jumping up to embrace her stepmother. &#8220;You
always say just the very right thing. Now, I&#8217;m
going back to work. I feel all rested now, and
I&#8217;m sure I can finish a lot to-day. Why, Nan
Fairfield! for goodness&#8217; sake! Is it really four
o&#8217;clock?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty had just noticed the time, and was
aghast! Two solid hours she had worked, and
only a small portion of one piece was done!
She hadn&#8217;t dreamed the time had flown so, and
thought it about three o&#8217;clock.
</p>
<p>Slightly disheartened at this discovery, she
went back to work. At first, the silks went
smoothly enough, then hurry and close application
brought on the fidgets again.
</p>
<p>Before five o&#8217;clock, she had to turn on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
electric lights, and then, to her dismay, the
tints of the silks changed, and she couldn&#8217;t tell
yellow from pink; or green from gray.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she thought, &#8220;I&#8217;ll work the bow-knots.
They&#8217;re of one solid colour, and it&#8217;s
straight sailing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Straight sailing it was,&mdash;but very tedious.
An untrue stitch spoiled the smooth continuance
of the embroidery that was to represent tied ribbon
bows. An untrue stitch&mdash;and she made
several&mdash;had to be picked out and done over,
and this often meant frayed silk, or an unsightly
needle hole in the linen.
</p>
<p>Long before Patty thought it was time, the
dressing-gong for dinner sounded.
</p>
<p>She jumped, greatly surprised at the flight of
time, but also relieved, that now she <i>must</i> lay
aside her work. She longed to throw herself
down on her couch and rest, but there was no
time for that.
</p>
<p>However, after she bathed and dressed, she
felt refreshed, and it was a bright, merry-faced
Patty who danced downstairs to greet her
father.
</p>
<p>If he thought her cheeks unusually pink, or
her eyes nervously bright, he made no allusion
to it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Puss, how goes the &#8216;occupation&#8217;?&#8221;
he said, patting her shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s progressing, father,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;but
if you&#8217;d just as leave, we won&#8217;t talk about it
to-night. I&#8217;ll tell you all about it, after I finish
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Pattykins; we business people
never like to &#8216;talk shop.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>And then Mr. Fairfield, who had been somewhat
enlightened by Nan as to how matters
stood, chatted gaily of other things, and Patty
forgot her troublesome work, and was quite
her own gay, saucy self again.
</p>
<p>Kenneth dropped in in the evening, to bring
a song which he had promised Patty. They
tried it over together, and then Patty said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you mind, Ken, if I ask you not to
stay any longer, to-night? I&#8217;ve something I
want to do, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mind? Of course not. I rather fancy we&#8217;re
good enough friends not to misunderstand each
other. If you&#8217;ll let me come and make up my
time some other night, I&#8217;ll skip out now, so
quick you can&#8217;t see me fly!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Patty, smiling at his hearty,
chummy manner. &#8220;I do wish you would. I&#8217;m
not often busy, as you know.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Course I know it. Good-night, lady, I&#8217;m
going to leave you now,&#8221; and with a hearty
handshake and a merry smile, Kenneth went
away, and Patty went to her own room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can work on that bow-knot part, to-night,&#8221;
she said to herself; &#8220;and then to-morrow, I&#8217;ll
get up early and do the rest of the flowers before
breakfast.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her task had begun to look hopeless, but she
was not yet ready to admit it, and she assured
herself that, of course, the others would go
much more rapidly than the first.
</p>
<p>She took down her hair and braided it into a
long pigtail; then she put on a comfortable
kimono and sat down to work.
</p>
<p>She stitched, and she stitched, and she stitched,
at the monotonous over and over bow-knots.
Doggedly she kept on, though her shoulders
ached, her eyes smarted, and her fingers trembled.
</p>
<p>With a kind of whimsical pathos, she repeated
to herself Hood&#8217;s &#8220;Song of the Shirt,&#8221;
and said, under her breath, &#8220;&#8216;Stitch, stitch,
stitch, till the cock is crowing aloof,&#8217; or whatever
it is!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then she saw by her watch that it was eleven
o&#8217;clock.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll just finish this bow,&#8221; she thought, &#8220;and
then, I&#8217;ll stop.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But before the bow was finished, there was a
tap at her door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s there?&#8221; said Patty, in a voice which
carried no invitation to enter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s us,&#8221; said Nan, firmly, if ungrammatically,
&#8220;and we&#8217;re coming in!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Fairfield entered, and Patty,
trying to make the best of it, looked up and
smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you do?&#8221; she said. &#8220;Take seats,
won&#8217;t you? I&#8217;m just amusing myself, you see.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But the tired voice had a quiver in it, for all
at once Patty saw that she had failed. She
had worked hard all the afternoon and evening,
and had not finished one of her thirty-six pieces!
It was this discovery that upset her, rather than
the unexpected visit from her parents.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Girlie, this won&#8217;t do,&#8221; began her father, in
his kindest tones.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it!&#8221; cried Patty, throwing down her
work, and flinging herself into her father&#8217;s
arms. &#8220;I can&#8217;t do it, daddy, I can&#8217;t! I haven&#8217;t
done one yet, and I never can do thirty-six!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thirty-six!&#8221; exclaimed Nan. &#8220;Patty, are
you crazy?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I think I must have been,&#8221; said Patty, laughing
a little hysterically, as she took the great
pile of centrepieces from a wardrobe, and threw
them into Nan&#8217;s lap.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&mdash;but you said a dozen!&#8221; said Nan, bewildered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; returned Patty. &#8220;<i>You</i>
said, did I bring a dozen, and I said yes. Also,
I brought two dozen more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To do in a week!&#8221; said Nan, in an awe struck
voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, to do in a week!&#8221; said Patty, mimicking
Nan&#8217;s tones; and then they both laughed.
</p>
<p>But Mr. Fairfield didn&#8217;t laugh. His limited
knowledge of embroidery made him ignorant of
how much work &#8220;three dozen&#8221; might mean,
but he knew the effect it had already had on
Patty, and he knew it was time to interfere.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My child&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he began, but Patty interrupted
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t waste words, daddy, dear,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;It&#8217;s all over. I&#8217;ve tried and failed; but remember,
this is only my first attempt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The fact that she realised her failure was in
a way a relief, for the strain of effort was over,
and she could now see the absurdity of the task
she had undertaken.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></p>
<p>She had reached what some one has called
&#8220;the peace of defeat,&#8221; and her spirits reacted
as after an escape from peril.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must have been crazy, Nan,&#8221; she said, sitting
down beside her on the couch. &#8220;Just
think; I&#8217;ve worked about six hours, and I&#8217;ve
done about half of one piece. And I brought
thirty-six!&#8221;
</p>
<p>This statement of the case gave Mr. Fairfield
a clearer idea, and he laughed, too.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Patty; I think I need say nothing more.
I see you know when you&#8217;re beaten, and I fancy
you won&#8217;t touch needle to that pile of work
again! I hope you can settle matters with your
&#8216;employer&#8217;; if not, I&#8217;ll help you out. But I
want to congratulate you on your pluck and
perseverance, even if,&mdash;well, even if they
were&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Crazy,&#8221; supplemented Patty.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>SLIPS AND SLEEVES</h3>
</div>

<p>The next morning Nan went with Patty
to take the centrepieces back to the embroidery
company.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall really like to see that woman,&#8221; said
Nan, as they reached the shop.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for her,&#8221; said Patty; &#8220;she&#8217;s so
pathetically weary and hopeless-looking.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So she was, and when Nan saw her, she felt
sorry for her, too.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t work as fast as you thought?&#8221; she
said to Patty, not unkindly, but with the hard
smile that seemed to be permanently fastened to
her face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I couldn&#8217;t,&#8221; confessed Patty. &#8220;I only
worked part of one piece. I&#8217;ve brought all the
rest back, in good order, and I want you to
redeem them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In her mechanical way, the woman took the
untouched centrepieces, looked at them critically,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
and laid them aside. Then she took up
the piece Patty had worked on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to deduct for this,&#8221; she said; &#8220;a
dollar and a half.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; asked Nan, angry at
what she considered gross injustice. &#8220;Miss
Fairfield does not ask payment; she is giving
you all that work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She has spoiled this piece for our use. She
works nicely enough, but no two people work
exactly alike, so no one else could now take this
and complete the corner. So, you see the piece
is valueless, and we must charge for it. Moreover,
I should have to deduct fifty cents if it
had been finished, because long stitches show on
the wrong side.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you don&#8217;t allow that?&#8221; said Nan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never. We deduct for that, or for soiling
the work, or for using wrong colours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Patty, &#8220;return me as much of
my deposit as is due me, and we&#8217;ll consider the
incident closed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Stolidly, the woman opened a drawer, counted
out sixteen dollars and a half, and gave it to
Patty, who said good-day, and stalked out of
the shop.
</p>
<p>Nan followed, and when they were seated in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
the motor-car, both broke into peals of laughter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Patty,&#8221; cried Nan, &#8220;what a financier
you are! You nearly killed yourself working
yesterday, and now you&#8217;ve paid a dollar and a
half for the privilege!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh!&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;Nothing of the sort.
I paid a dollar and a half for some valuable
experience, and I think I got it cheap enough!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose you did. Well, what are you
going to do next? For I know you well enough
to know you&#8217;re not going to give up your scheme
entirely.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed I&#8217;m not! But to-day I&#8217;m going to
frivol. I worked hard enough yesterday to deserve
a rest, and I&#8217;m going to take it. Come
on, let&#8217;s go somewhere nice to luncheon, and
then go to a matinée; it&#8217;s Wednesday.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well; I think you do need recreation.
I&#8217;ll take you to Cherry&#8217;s for luncheon, and then
we&#8217;ll go to see a comic opera, or some light
comedy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a great comfort, Nan,&#8221; said Patty.
&#8220;You always do just the right thing. But you
needn&#8217;t think you can divert my mind to the extent
of making me give up this plan of mine.
For I won&#8217;t do that.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I know you won&#8217;t. But next time do try
something easier.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall. I&#8217;ve already made up my mind what
it&#8217;s to be; and truly, it&#8217;s dead easy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought your red-headed friend cured you
of using slang,&#8221; said Nan, smiling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought so, too,&#8221; said Patty, with an air
of innocent surprise. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it queer how one
can be mistaken?&#8221;
</p>
<p>True to her determination, Patty started out
again the following morning to get an &#8220;occupation,&#8221;
as they all termed it.
</p>
<p>Again Miller was amazed at the address given
him, but he said nothing, and proceeded to drive
Patty to it.
</p>
<p>It was even less attractive than the former
shop, being nothing more or less than an establishment
where &#8220;white work&#8221; was given out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How many?&#8221; asked the woman in charge,
and, profiting by past experience, Patty said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;One dozen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The woman took her name and address, in a
quick, business-like way.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One dollar a dozen,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Must be
returned within the week. Deductions made
for all imperfections.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She handed Patty a large bundle done up in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
newspaper, and, with flaming cheeks, Patty
walked out of the shop.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Home, Miller,&#8221; she said, and though the
man was too well trained to look surprised, he
couldn&#8217;t keep an expression of astonishment out
of his eyes when he saw Patty&#8217;s burden.
</p>
<p>On the way home she opened the parcel.
</p>
<p>There were in it twelve infants&#8217; slips, of rather
coarse muslin. They were cut out, but not
basted.
</p>
<p>Patty looked a little doubtful, then she
thought:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, pshaw! It&#8217;s very different from that
fine embroidery. I can swish these through the
sewing-machine in no time at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Reaching home, she threw the lap-robe over
her bundle, and hurried into the house with it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty,&#8221; called Nan, as she whisked upstairs
to her own room, &#8220;come here, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, in a minute,&#8221; Patty called back, flying
on upstairs, and depositing the bundle in a
wardrobe.
</p>
<p>She locked the door, and hid the key, then
went demurely downstairs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Occupation all right?&#8221; asked Nan, smiling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Patty, jauntily. &#8220;Good work
this time; not so fine and fussy.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well; I only wanted to tell you that Elise
telephoned, and wants you to go to a concert
with her this afternoon. I forget where it is;
she said for you to call her up as soon as you
came home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, I will,&#8221; said Patty, and she went
to the telephone at once.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lovely concert, Nan,&#8221; she said, as she
returned. &#8220;Jigamarigski is going to sing, and
afterward I&#8217;m to go home with Elise to dinner,
and they&#8217;ll bring me home. What shall I
wear?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wear your light green cloth suit, and your
furs,&#8221; said Nan, after a moment&#8217;s consideration.
&#8220;And your big white beaver hat. It&#8217;s
too dressy an affair for your black hat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Apparently the &#8220;occupation&#8221; was forgotten,
for during luncheon time, Patty chatted about
the concert and other matters, and at two
o&#8217;clock she went away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You look lovely,&#8221; said Nan, as, in her pretty
cloth suit, and white hat and furs, Patty came
to say good-by.
</p>
<p>The concert proved most enjoyable. Dinner
at the Farringtons&#8217; was equally so, and when
Patty reached home at about nine o&#8217;clock,
she had much to tell Nan and her father,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
who were always glad to hear of her social
pleasures.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the occupation?&#8221; asked Mr. Fairfield.
&#8220;How is it progressing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nicely, thank you,&#8221; returned Patty. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
picked an easy one this time. One has to learn,
you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Smiling, she went to her room that night, determined
to attack the work next morning and
hurry it through.
</p>
<p>But next morning came a note from Clementine,
asking Patty to go to the photographer&#8217;s
with her at ten, and as Patty had promised to
do this when called on, she didn&#8217;t like to refuse.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And, anyway,&#8221; she thought, &#8220;a week is a
week. Whatever day I begin this new work, I
shall have a week from that day to earn the
fifteen dollars in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then, that afternoon was so fine, she went for
a motor-ride with Nan.
</p>
<p>And the next day, some guests came to luncheon,
and naturally, Patty couldn&#8217;t absent herself
without explanation.
</p>
<p>And then came Sunday. And so it was Monday
morning before Patty began her new work.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me to any one who comes, Nan,&#8221; she
said, as she left the breakfast table. &#8220;I have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
to work to-day, and I mustn&#8217;t be interrupted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Nan. &#8220;I think, myself,
it&#8217;s time you began, if you&#8217;re going to accomplish
anything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Armed with her pile of work, and her basket
of sewing materials, Patty went up to the
fourth floor, where a small room was set apart
as a sewing-room. It was rarely used, save by
the maids, for Nan was not fond of sewing;
but there was a good sewing-machine there, and
ample light and space.
</p>
<p>Full of enthusiasm, Patty seated herself at the
sewing-machine, and picked up the cut-out work.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be very systematic,&#8221; she thought. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
do all the side seams first; then all the hems;
then I&#8217;ll stitch up all the little sleeves at once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The plan worked well. The simple little garments
had but two seams, and setting the machine
stitch rather long, Patty whizzed the little
white slips through, one after the other, singing
in time to her treadle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s too easy!&#8221; she thought, as in a
short time the twenty-four seams were neatly
stitched.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, for the hems.&#8221;
</p>
<p>These were a little more troublesome, as they
had to be folded and basted; but still, it was an
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
easy task, and Patty worked away like a busy
bee.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now for the babykins&#8217; sleeves,&#8221; she said,
but just then the luncheon gong sounded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not really!&#8221; cried Patty, aloud, as she
glanced at her watch.
</p>
<p>But in very truth it was one o&#8217;clock, and it
was a thoughtful Patty who walked slowly
downstairs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nan,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;the trouble with an
occupation is, that there&#8217;s not time enough in a
day, or a half-day, to do anything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nan nodded her head sagaciously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always noticed that,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s
only when you&#8217;re playing, that there&#8217;s any time.
If you try to work, there&#8217;s no time at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit!&#8221; echoed Patty, &#8220;and what there
is, glides through your fingers before you know
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She hurried through her luncheon, and returned
to the sewing-room. She was not tired,
but there was a great deal yet to do.
</p>
<p>The tiny sleeves she put through the machine,
one after another, until she had twenty-four in
a long chain, linked by a single stitch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, method and system accomplish wonders,&#8221;
she thought, as she snipped the sleeves
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
apart, and rapidly folded hems round the little
wrists.
</p>
<p>But even with method and system, twenty-four
is a large number, and as Patty turned the last
hem, twilight fell, and she turned on the lights.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness, gracious!&#8221; she thought. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
yet all these sleeves to set, and stitch in, and the
fronts to finish off; and a buttonhole to work in
each neckband.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But it was only half-past four, and by half-past
six they were all finished but the buttonholes.
</p>
<p>And Patty was nearly finished, too!
</p>
<p>She had not realised how physically tired she
was. Running the sewing-machine all day was
an unusual exertion, and when she reached her
own room, with her arms full of the little white
garments, she threw them on the bed, and threw
herself on the couch, weary in every bone and
muscle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what luck?&#8221; said Nan, appearing at
Patty&#8217;s doorway, herself all dressed for dinner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Nan,&#8221; cried Patty, laughing, &#8220;me
legs is broke; and me arms is broke; and me
back is broke. But I&#8217;m not nervous or worried,
and I&#8217;m going to win out this time! But, Nan,
I just <i>can&#8217;t</i> go down to dinner. Send Jane up
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
with a tray,&mdash;there&#8217;s a dear. And tell father
I&#8217;m all right, but I don&#8217;t care to mingle in
society to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re in good spirits,&#8221;
said Nan, half annoyed, half laughing, as she
saw the pile of white work on the bed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Run along, Nan, there&#8217;s a good lady,&#8221; said
Patty, jumping up, and urging Nan out the
door. &#8220;Skippy-skip, before father comes up
to learn the latest news from the seat of war.
Tell him everything is all right, and I&#8217;m earning
my living with neatness and despatch, only
working girls simply can&#8217;t get into chiffons and
dine with the &#8216;quality.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Reassured by Patty&#8217;s gay air, Nan went downstairs,
laughing, and told her husband that
she believed Patty would yet accomplish her
project.
</p>
<p>&#8220;These experiences will do her no harm,&#8221; said
Mr. Fairfield, after hearing Nan&#8217;s story. &#8220;So
long as she doesn&#8217;t get nervous or mentally upset,
we&#8217;ll let her go on with her experiment.
She&#8217;s a peculiar nature, and has a wonderful
amount of will-power for one so young.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always heard you were called stubborn,&#8221;
said Nan, smiling, &#8220;though I&#8217;ve never seen it
specially exemplified in your case.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></p>
<p>&#8220;One doesn&#8217;t need to be stubborn with
such an angelic disposition as yours in the
house,&#8221; he returned, and Nan smiled happily,
for she knew the words were lovingly in
earnest.
</p>
<p>Meantime, Patty was sitting luxuriously in a
big easy-chair, eating her dinner from the tray
Jane had brought her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is rather fun,&#8221; she thought; &#8220;and my,
but running a sewing-machine does give one an
appetite! I could eat two trays-full, I verily
believe. Thank goodness, I&#8217;ve no more stitching
to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Having despatched her dinner, perhaps a trifle
hastily, Patty reluctantly left her big easy-chair
for a small rocker by the drop-light.
</p>
<p>She wearily picked up a little gown, cut a buttonhole
at the throat, and proceeded to work it.
As she was so skilful at embroidery, of course
this was easy work; but Patty was tired, and her
fingers almost refused to push the needle
through the cloth. About ten o&#8217;clock Nan
came upstairs.
</p>
<p>Patty was just sewing on the last button, the
buttonholes being all done.
</p>
<p>This fact made her jubilant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nan!&#8221; she cried; &#8220;what <i>do</i> you think!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
I&#8217;ve made a whole dozen of these baby-slips
to-day!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty! You don&#8217;t mean it! Why, my dear
child, how could you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;On the machine. And they&#8217;re done neatly,
aren&#8217;t they?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they are, indeed. But Patty&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate to tell you,&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, what is it, Nan? Is the material wrong
side out?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you goosie, there&#8217;s no right or wrong
side to cotton cloth, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, tell me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Every one of these little sleeves is made upside
down!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Nan! It can&#8217;t be!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they are, dearie. See, this wider part
should have been at the top.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Nan, what shall I do? I thought they
were sort of flowing sleeves, you know. Kimono-shaped
ones, I mean.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; they&#8217;re set wrong. Oh, Patty, why
didn&#8217;t you let me help you? But you told me
to keep away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know I did. Now, I&#8217;ve spoiled the
whole dozen! I like them just as well that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
way, myself, but I know they&#8217;ll &#8216;deduct&#8217; for
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty, I don&#8217;t think you ought to do &#8216;white
work&#8217; anyway. How much are they going to
pay you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A dollar a dozen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ve done a dozen in a day. That
won&#8217;t bring you fifteen dollars in a week.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I thought the second dozen would go
faster, and it probably will. And, of course,
I shan&#8217;t make that mistake with the sleeves
again. Truly, Nan, it&#8217;s a heap easier than embroidery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t worry over it to-night,&#8221; said
Nan, kissing her. &#8220;Take a hot bath and hop
into bed. Perhaps you have found the right
work after all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nan didn&#8217;t really think she had, but Patty had
begun to look worried, and Nan feared she
wouldn&#8217;t be able to sleep.
</p>
<p>But sleep she did, from sheer physical exhaustion.
</p>
<p>And woke next morning, almost unable to
move! Every muscle in her body was lame
from her strenuous machine work. She couldn&#8217;t
rise from her bed, and could scarcely raise her
head from the pillow.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></p>
<p>When Catherine, Nan&#8217;s maid, came to her
room, Patty said, faintly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask Mrs. Fairfield to come up, please.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nan came, and Patty looked at her comically,
as she said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nan, I&#8217;m vanquished, but not subdued. I&#8217;m
just one mass of lameness and ache, but if you
think I&#8217;ve given up my plan, you&#8217;re greatly
mistaken. However, I&#8217;m through with &#8216;white
work,&#8217; and I&#8217;ve sewed my last sew on a
machine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Patty girl, you&#8217;re really ill,&#8221; said Nan,
sympathetically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not! I&#8217;m perfectly well. Just a
trifle lame from over-exercise yesterday. I&#8217;ll
stay in bed to-day, and Nan, dear, if you
love me, take those slips back to the kind
lady who let me have them to play with.
Make her pay you a dollar for the dozen,
and don&#8217;t let her deduct more than a dollar for
the upside-downness of the sleeves. Tell her
they&#8217;re prettier that way, anyway. And, Catharine,
do please rub me with some healing lotion
or something,&mdash;for I&#8217;m as lame as a jelly-fish!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty,&#8221; said Nan, solemnly, &#8220;the occasion
requires strong language. So I will remark in
all seriousness, that, you do beat all!&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>THE CLEVER GOLDFISH</h3>
</div>

<p>FINANCIALLY, Patty came out just
even on her &#8216;white work,&#8217; for though the
woman paid Nan the dollar for the
dozen finished garments, she deducted the same
amount for the wrongly placed sleeves.
</p>
<p>She also grumbled at the long machine stitch
Patty had used, but Nan&#8217;s patience was exhausted,
and giving the woman a calm stare,
she walked out of the shop.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s perfectly awful,&#8221; she said to Patty,
when relating her adventure, &#8220;to think of the
poor girls who are really trying to earn their
living by white work. It&#8217;s all very well for
you, who are only experimenting, but suppose a
real worker gets all her pay deducted!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s hardly enough pay to pay for deducting
it, anyway,&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;Oh, Nan, it
is dreadful! I suppose lots of poor girls who
feel as tired and lame as I do this morning, have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
to go straight back to their sewing-machine and
run it all day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course they do; and often they&#8217;re of delicate
constitutions, and insufficiently nourished.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It makes me feel awful. Things are unevenly
divided in this world, aren&#8217;t they, Nan?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are, my dear; but as that problem has
baffled wiser heads than yours, it&#8217;s useless for
you to worry over it. You can&#8217;t reform the
world.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; and I don&#8217;t intend to try. But I can
do something to help. I know I can. That&#8217;s
where people show their lack of a sense of proportion.
I know I can&#8217;t do anything for the
world, as a world, but if I can help in a few
individual cases, that will be my share. For
instance, if I can help this Christine Farley to
an art education, and so to a successful career,
why that&#8217;s so much to the good. And though
father has set me a hard task to bring it about,
I&#8217;m going to do it yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father wouldn&#8217;t have set you such a
task if you hadn&#8217;t declared it was no task at
all! You said you could earn your living easily
in a dozen different ways. Already you&#8217;ve discarded
two.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That leaves me ten!&#8221; said Patty, airily.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
&#8220;Ten ways of earning a living is a fair show.
I can discard nine more and still have a chance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Patsy. I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re not disheartened.
And I suppose you are learning
something of the conditions of our social economy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gracious, Nan! How you <i>do</i> talk! Are
you quite sure you know what you mean?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but I thought you would,&#8221; said Nan,
and with that parting shot, she left the room.
</p>
<p>It was late in the afternoon before Patty
dawdled downstairs.
</p>
<p>Her shoulders and the back of her neck still
ached, but otherwise she felt all right again,
and her spirits had risen proportionately.
</p>
<p>About four o&#8217;clock Kenneth called, bringing a
mysterious burden, which he carried with great
care.
</p>
<p>He knew of Patty&#8217;s scheme, and though he
appreciated the nobility of her endeavour, he
could not feel very sanguine hopes of her
success.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not cut out for a wage-earner,
Patty,&#8221; he had said to her; &#8220;it&#8217;s like a butterfly
making bread.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t want to be a butterfly,&#8221; Patty
had pouted.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t mean butterfly,&mdash;as so many
people do,&mdash;to represent a frivolous, useless
person. I have a great respect for butterflies,
myself. And you radiate the same effect of joy,
happiness, gladness, and beauty, as a butterfly
does when hovering around in the golden sunshine
of a summer day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Ken, I didn&#8217;t know you were a poet.
But you haven&#8217;t proved your case.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I have. It&#8217;s your mission in life to be
happy, and so to make others happy. This you
can do without definite effort, so stick to your
calling, and let the more prosaic people, the
plodders,&mdash;earn wages.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me earn the wages of my country, and
I care not who makes it smile,&#8221; Patty had rejoined,
and there the subject had dropped.
</p>
<p>To-day, when he arrived, carrying what was
evidently something fragile, Patty greeted him
gaily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not working to-day,&#8221; she said; &#8220;so you
can stay &#8217;most an hour if you like.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I will; and if you&#8217;ll wait till I set
down this precious burden, I&#8217;ll shake hands
with you. I come, like the Greeks, bearing
gifts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A gift? Oh, what is it? I&#8217;m crazy to see it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s a gift; but, incidentally, it&#8217;s a
plan for wage-earning. If you really want to
wage-earn, you may as well do it in an interesting
way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Patty, demurely, for she well
knew he was up to some sort of foolery. &#8220;My
attempts so far, though absorbing, were not
really interesting.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, this is!&#8221; declared Kenneth, who was
carefully taking the tissue papers from his gift,
which proved to be a glass globe, containing
two goldfish.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are Darby and Juliet,&#8221; he remarked,
as he looked anxiously into the bowl. &#8220;I am
so tired of hackneyed pairs of names, that I&#8217;ve
varied these. But, won&#8217;t you send for some
more water? I had to bring them with only a
little, for fear I&#8217;d spill it, and they seem to
have drunk it nearly all up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense! they don&#8217;t drink the water; they
only swim in it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the trouble. There isn&#8217;t enough for
them to swim in. And yet there&#8217;s too much for
them to drink.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty rang for Jane, who then brought them
a pitcher of ice water.
</p>
<p>Kenneth poured it in, but at the sudden cold
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
deluge, Darby and Juliet began to behave in
an extraordinary manner. They flew madly
round and round the bowl, hitting each other,
and breathing in gasps.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The water&#8217;s too cold,&#8221; cried Patty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course it is,&#8221; said Kenneth; &#8220;get some
hot water, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty ran herself for the hot water, and returned
with a pitcher full.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want a little mustard?&#8221; she said,
giggling. &#8220;I know they&#8217;ve taken cold. A hot
mustard foot-bath is fine for colds.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And that is very odd, because they haven&#8217;t
any feet,&#8221; quoted Kenneth, as he poured the hot
water in very slowly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want a bath thermometer?&#8221; went
on Patty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; when they stop wriggling it&#8217;s warm
enough. There, now they&#8217;re all right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kenneth set down the hot water pitcher and
looked with pride on the two fish, who had certainly
stopped wriggling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re awful quiet,&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;Are
you sure they&#8217;re all right? I think you&#8217;ve boiled
them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing of the sort. They like warmth,
only it makes them sort of&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Dormant,&#8221; suggested Patty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, clever child, dormant. And now while
they sleep, I&#8217;ll tell you my plan. You see, these
are extra intelligent goldfish,&mdash;especially Juliet,
the one with a black spot on her shoulder.
Well, you&#8217;ve only to train them a bit, and then
give exhibitions of your trained goldfish!
You&#8217;ve no idea what a hit it will make.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Kenneth, you&#8217;re a genius!&#8221; cried Patty,
meeting his fun halfway. &#8220;It&#8217;s lots easier than
white work. Come on, help me train them,
won&#8217;t you? How do we begin?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re still sleepy,&#8221; said Kenneth, looking
at the inert fish. &#8220;They need stirring up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get a spoon,&#8221; said Patty, promptly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, just waggle the water with your finger.
They&#8217;ll come up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty waggled the water with her finger, but
Darby only blinked at her, while Juliet flounced
petulantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s high-strung,&#8221; observed Kenneth, &#8220;and
a trifle bad-tempered. But she won&#8217;t stand
scolding. Let&#8217;s take her out and pet her a
little.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you get her out? With a hook and
line?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, silly! You must be kind to them.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
Here, puss, puss, puss! Come, Jooly-ooly-et!
Come!&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Juliet haughtily ignored the invitation and
huddled in the bottom of the bowl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Try this,&#8221; said Patty, running to the dining-room,
and returning with a silver fish server.
</p>
<p>This worked beautifully, and Kenneth scooped
up Juliet, who lay quietly on the broad silver
blade, blinking at them reproachfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s hungry, Ken; see how she opens and
shuts her mouth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; she&#8217;s trying to talk. I told you she was
clever. I daresay you can teach her to sing.
She looks just as you do when you take a high
note.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You horrid boy! But she does, really. Anyway,
let&#8217;s feed them. What do they eat?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I brought their food with me; it&#8217;s some
patent stuff, very well advertised. Here,
Julie!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gently slipping Juliet back into the water, Ken
scattered some food on the surface.
</p>
<p>Both fish rose to the occasion and greedily ate
the floating particles.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the trouble,&#8221; said Ken. &#8220;They have
no judgment. They overeat, and then they die
of apoplexy. And, too, if they eat too much,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
you can&#8217;t train them to stand on their tails and
beg.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, will they learn to do that? And what
else can we teach them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, anything acrobatic; trapeze work and
that. But they&#8217;re sleepy now; you fed them
too much for just an afternoon tea. Let&#8217;s
leave them to their nap, and train them after
they wake up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right; let&#8217;s sit down and talk seriously.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty, you&#8217;re always ready to talk seriously
of late. That&#8217;s why I brought you some Nonsense
Fish, to lighten your mood a little.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you worry about my mood, Ken; it&#8217;s
light enough. But I want you to help me earn
my living for a week. Will you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That I will not! I&#8217;ll be no party to your
foolishness.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Ken,&#8221; went on Patty, for she knew
his &#8220;bark was worse than his bite,&#8221; &#8220;I don&#8217;t
want you to do anything much. But, in your
law office, where you&#8217;re studying, aren&#8217;t there
some papers I can copy, or something like
that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty, you&#8217;re a back number. That &#8216;copying&#8217;
that you mean is all out of date. In these
days of typewriters and manifold thigamajigs,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
we lawyers don&#8217;t have much copying done by
hand. Except, perhaps, engrossing. Can you
do that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How prettily you say &#8216;we lawyers,&#8217;&#8221; teased
Patty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I do. I&#8217;m getting in practice
against the time it&#8217;ll be true. But if you really
want to copy, buy a nice Spencerian Copy-book,
and fill up its pages. It&#8217;ll be about as valuable
as any other work of the sort.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ken, you&#8217;re horrid. So unsympathetic.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m crool only to be kind! You must know,
Patty, that copying is out of the question.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, never mind then; let&#8217;s talk of something
else.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Let&#8217;s sit upon the ground and tell strange
stories of the death of kings.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Ken, that reminds me. You know my
crystal ball?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do indeed; I selected it with utmost care.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s a gem. Perfectly flawless. Well,
I&#8217;ll get it, and see if we can see things in it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty ran for her crystal, and returning to the
library held it up to the fading sunlight, and
tried to look into it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t the way, Patty; you have to lay
it on black velvet, or something dark.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, do you? Well, here&#8217;s a dark mat on
this table. Try that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They gazed intently into the ball, and though
they could see nothing, Patty felt a weird sense
of uncanniness.
</p>
<p>Ken laughed when she declared this, and said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing in the world but suggestion. You
think a Japanese crystal <i>ought</i> to make you feel
supernatural, and so you imagine it does. But
it doesn&#8217;t any such nonsense. Now, I&#8217;ll tell
you why I like them. Only because they&#8217;re so
flawlessly perfect. In shape, colour, texture,&mdash;if
you can call it texture,&mdash;but I mean material
or substance. There isn&#8217;t an attribute that
they possess, except in perfection. That&#8217;s a
great thing, Patty; and you can&#8217;t say it of anything
else.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The stars,&#8221; said Patty, trying to look wise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, pshaw! I mean things made by man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Great pictures,&#8221; she suggested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Their perfection is a matter of opinion. One
man deems a picture perfect, another man does
not. But a crystal ball is indubitably perfect.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indubitably is an awful big word,&#8221; said
Patty. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said Kenneth, kindly, &#8220;I
won&#8217;t let it hurt you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></p>
<p>Then the doorbell rang, and in a moment in
came Elise and Roger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Ken,&#8221; said Elise. &#8220;We came for
Patty to go skating. Will you go, too?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t go to-day,&#8221; said Patty, &#8220;I&#8217;m too
tired. And it&#8217;s too late, anyway. You stay
here, and we&#8217;ll have tea.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; said Elise, taking
off her furs.
</p>
<p>The quartette gathered round the library fire,
and Jane brought in the tea things.
</p>
<p>Patty made tea very prettily, for she excelled
in domestic accomplishments, and as she handed
Kenneth his cup, she said, roguishly, &#8220;There&#8217;s
a perfect cup of tea, I can assure you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perfect tea, all right,&#8221; returned Ken, sipping
it, &#8220;but a cup of tea can&#8217;t be a perfect
thing, as it hasn&#8217;t complete symmetry of form.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you two talking about?&#8221; demanded
Elise, who didn&#8217;t want Ken and Patty
to have secrets from which she was excluded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Speaking of crystal balls,&#8221; said Patty, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
show you one, Elise; a big one, too! Get Darby
and Juliet, won&#8217;t you please, Ken?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kenneth obligingly brought the glass globe in
from the dining-room, where they had left the
goldfish to be by themselves.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How jolly!&#8221; cried Elise. &#8220;And what lovely
goldfish! These are the real Japanese ones,
aren&#8217;t they?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Patty, smiling at Ken. &#8220;Being
Japanese, they&#8217;re perfect of their kind. Make
them stand on their tails and beg, Kenneth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, will they do that?&#8221; said Elise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only on Wednesdays and Saturdays,&#8221; said
Kenneth, gravely. &#8220;And on Fridays they sing.
To-day is their rest day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They look morbid,&#8221; said Roger. &#8220;Shall I
jolly them up a bit?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s give them tea,&#8221; said Elise, tilting her
spoon until a few drops fell into the water.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll make them nervous,&#8221; warned Patty,
&#8220;and Juliet is high-strung, anyway.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then Nan came in from her afternoon&#8217;s round
of calls, and then Mr. Fairfield arrived, and
they too were called upon to make friends with
Darby and Juliet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Goldfish always make me think of a story
about Whistler,&#8221; said Mr. Fairfield. &#8220;It
seems, Whistler once had a room in a house in
Florence, directly over a person who had some
pet goldfish in a bowl. Every pleasant day the
bowl was set out on the balcony, which was exactly
beneath Whistler&#8217;s balcony. For days he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
resisted the temptation to fish for them with a
bent pin and a string; but at last he succumbed
to his angling instincts, and caught them all.
Then, remorseful at what he had done, he fried
them to a fine golden brown, and returned them
to their owner on a platter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ugh!&#8221; cried Nan, &#8220;what a horrid story!
Why do they always tack unpleasant stories on
poor old Whistler? Now, I know a lovely
story about a goldfish, which I will relate. It
is said to be the composition of a small Boston
schoolchild.
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, Robin, lovely goldfish!</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 2em;'>Who teached you how to fly?</p>

<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 2em;'>&#8217;Twas God, &#8217;twas God what done it.&#8217;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Isn&#8217;t that lovely?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is, indeed,&#8221; agreed Kenneth. &#8220;If that&#8217;s
Boston precocity, it&#8217;s more attractive than I
thought.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But it doesn&#8217;t rhyme,&#8221; said Elise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Patty; &#8220;that&#8217;s the beauty of it.
It&#8217;s blank verse, as the greatest poetry often is.
Don&#8217;t go yet, Elise. Stay to dinner, can&#8217;t
you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, I can&#8217;t stay to-night, Patty, dear. Will
you go skating to-morrow?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty hesitated. She wanted to go, but also
she wanted to get at that &#8220;occupation&#8221; of
hers, for she had a new one in view.
</p>
<p>She was about to say she would go skating,
however, when she saw a twinkle in her father&#8217;s
eye that made her change her mind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t, Elise,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve an engagement
to-morrow. Will telephone you some day
when I can go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t wait too long; the ice will be all
gone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then the young people went away, and Patty
went thoughtfully upstairs to her room to dress
for dinner.
</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>A BUSY MORNING</h3>
</div>

<p>The next morning, Patty came down to
breakfast, wearing a plain street costume,
a small, but very well made hat,
and a look of determination.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fresh start?&#8221; said her father, smiling
kindly at her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she replied; &#8220;and this time I conquer.
I see success already perching on my
banners.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t then!&#8221; declared Nan. &#8220;I
see you coming home, not with your shield, but
on it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, don&#8217;t be a wet blanket and throw
cold water on my plans,&#8221; said Patty, a little
mixed in her metaphor, but smiling placidly at
her stepmother. &#8220;This time it&#8217;s really a most
sensible undertaking that I&#8217;m going to undertake.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sounds as if you were going into the undertaking
business,&#8221; said her father, &#8220;but I assume
you don&#8217;t mean that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I go into a pleasanter atmosphere than
that suggests, and one in which I feel sure I can
accomplish good work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Patty,&#8221; said Mr. Fairfield, &#8220;it&#8217;s lucky
you&#8217;re of a sanguine temperament. I&#8217;m glad
to see you&#8217;re not disheartened by failure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not I! To me a failure only means a more
vigorous attempt next time. Now, Nan, I
shall be away all day,&mdash;until about five o&#8217;clock.
Won&#8217;t you play with Darby and Juliet a little,
so they won&#8217;t get lonesome?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; I&#8217;ll amuse them. But, Patty, where
are you going?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, pretty stepmothery; don&#8217;t ask
questions, for they won&#8217;t be answered. If all
goes well, I&#8217;ll tell you on my return.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Fairfield looked serious.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you know you&#8217;re not to
do anything unbecoming or ridiculous. Don&#8217;t
you go and sell goods behind a counter, or anything
extreme like that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir; I won&#8217;t. I promise not to put myself
in the public eye in any such fashion. And
you may trust me, father, not to do anything of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
which you&#8217;d disapprove, if you knew all about
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good Patty-girl! Well, go ahead
in your mad career, and if you keep your part
of the bargain, I&#8217;ll keep mine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty started off, and this time she gave Miller
an address not so far away as before. When
he brought the motor-car to a standstill, before
a fashionable millinery shop, he felt none of
the surprise that he had when he took Patty to
what he considered inappropriate places.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Miller,&#8221; said Patty, as she got out
of the car, &#8220;you are not to wait for me, but I
want you to return here for me at five o&#8217;clock.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, Miss Fairfield?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; right here. Come exactly at five, and
wait for me to come out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Miss Fairfield,&#8221; said Miller, and Patty
turned and entered the shop.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m &#8217;most sorry I sent him away,&#8221; she
thought to herself, &#8220;for I may not want to
stay. Well, I can go home in a street-car.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Though Patty&#8217;s costume was plain and inconspicuous,
it bore so evidently the stamp of taste
and refinement, that the saleswoman who met
her assumed she had come to buy a hat.
</p>
<p>But it was early for fashionable ladies to be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
out shopping, so the rather supercilious young
woman greeted Patty with a cautious air of
reserve. It was so different from the effusive
manner usually shown to Nan and Patty when
they really went shopping, that Patty was
secretly much amused. But as she was also
secretly greatly embarrassed, it was with an uncertain
air that she said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not shopping; I wish to see Madame
Villard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Madame is not here. What can I do for
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have come in answer to her advertisement
for an assistant milliner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said the young woman, raising her
eyebrows, and at once showing an air of
haughty condescension. &#8220;You should have
asked for the forewoman, not Madame.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty&#8217;s sense of humour got the better of her
resentment, and it was with difficulty she repressed
a smile, as she answered:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed? Well, it is not yet too late to correct
my error. Will you show me to the forewoman?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty&#8217;s inflections were not in the least sarcastic,
in fact her whole manner was gentle and
gracious, but something in her tone, perhaps
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
the note of amusement, made the saleswoman
look at her suddenly and sharply.
</p>
<p>But Patty&#8217;s face was demure and showed
only a desire to be conducted to the right
person.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come this way,&#8221; said the young woman,
shortly, and she led Patty, between some heavy
curtains, to a back room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is our forewoman, Miss O&#8217;Flynn,&#8221; she
said, as she ushered Patty into her presence.
</p>
<p>Miss O&#8217;Flynn was an important looking woman
who took in every detail of Patty&#8217;s appearance
in a series of careful and systematic
glances.
</p>
<p>She seemed puzzled at what she saw, and said,
inquiringly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Fairfield,&#8221; said Patty, pleasantly,
&#8220;and I have come in answer to your advertisement.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For assistant milliner? You.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss O&#8217;Flynn was surprised out of her usual
calm by the amazing proposition of the young
stranger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Patty, quite calm herself. &#8220;I
can trim hats very prettily.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you trim the one you have on?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, no,&#8221; admitted Patty. &#8220;I brought
this from Paris. But I am sure I can trim hats
to suit you. May I try?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What experience have you had?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&mdash;not any professional experience.
You see, it is only recently that I have desired
to earn my own living.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&mdash;sudden reverses,&#8221; murmured Miss
O&#8217;Flynn, thinking she had solved the problem.
&#8220;Well, my dear, you have evidently been
brought up a lady, so it will be hard for you to
find work. I am sorry to say I cannot employ
you, as I engage only skilled workwomen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But trimming hats doesn&#8217;t require professional
skill,&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;Only good taste
and a,&mdash;a sort of knack at bows and things.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss O&#8217;Flynn laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything requires professional skill,&#8221; she
returned. &#8220;A course of training is necessary
for any position.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But if you&#8217;d try me,&#8221; said Patty, quite unconscious
that her tone was pleading. &#8220;Just
give me a day&#8217;s trial, and if I don&#8217;t make good,
you needn&#8217;t pay me anything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss O&#8217;Flynn was more puzzled than ever.
Insistent though Patty was, it didn&#8217;t seem to
her the insistence of a poor girl wanting to earn
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
her bread; it was more like the determination
of a wilful child to attain its desire.
</p>
<p>So, moved rather by curiosity to see how it
would turn out, than a belief in Patty&#8217;s ability,
she said, coldly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will do as you ask. You may go to the
workroom for to-day; but on the understanding
that unless you show unusual skill or aptitude
to learn, you are not to be paid anything, nor
are you to come to-morrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Patty, smiling jubilantly at
having received her opportunity, at least.
</p>
<p>Miss O&#8217;Flynn took her to a workroom, where
several girls were busily engaged in various
sorts of millinery work.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit here, Miss Fairfield,&#8221; and Miss O&#8217;Flynn
indicated a chair at one end of a long table.
&#8220;You may line this hat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then she gave Patty an elaborate velvet hat,
trimmed with feathers, and materials for sewing.
She also gave her white silk for the lining
of the hat, and a piece stamped with gilt letters,
which Patty knew must be placed inside the
crown.
</p>
<p>It all seemed easy,&mdash;too easy, in fact, for
Patty aspired to making velvet rosettes, and
placing ostrich plumes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></p>
<p>But she knew she was being tested, and she set
to work at her task with energy.
</p>
<p>Though she had never lined a hat before, she
knew in a general way how it should be done,
and she tried to go about it with an air of experience.
The other girls at the table cast
furtive glances at her.
</p>
<p>Though they were not rude, they showed that
air of hostile criticism, so often shown by habitués
to a newcomer, though based on nothing
but prejudiced curiosity.
</p>
<p>But as Patty began to cut the lining, she saw
involuntary smiles spring to their faces. She
knew that she must be cutting it wrongly, but it
seemed to her the only way to cut it, so she went
on.
</p>
<p>The girls began to nudge each other, and to
smile more openly, and, to her own chagrin,
Patty felt her cheeks growing red with embarrassment.
</p>
<p>She was tempted to speak pleasantly to them,
and ask what her mistake was, but a strange
notion of honesty forbade this.
</p>
<p>She had said at home that she believed it
would be possible for her to earn her living
without special instruction, and it seemed to her,
that if she now asked for advice it would be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
like getting special training, though in a small
degree.
</p>
<p>So she went calmly on with her work; cut and
fitted the hat lining, and carefully sewed it in
the hat.
</p>
<p>Remembering that the stitch she used on her
&#8220;white work&#8221; had been criticised as too long,
she now was careful to take very short stitches,
and she used her utmost endeavour to make her
work neat and dainty.
</p>
<p>Miss O&#8217;Flynn passed her chair two or three
times while the work was in progress, but she
made no comment of any sort.
</p>
<p>It was perhaps eleven o&#8217;clock when Patty
completed the task. Next time Miss O&#8217;Flynn
came by her she handed her the hat with an
unmistakable air of triumph.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve done it,&#8221; Patty thought to herself,
exultantly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve lined that hat, and, if I
do say it that shouldn&#8217;t, it&#8217;s done perfectly;
neat, smooth, and correct in every particular.&#8221;
</p>
<p>While Patty was indulging in these self-congratulatory
thoughts, Miss O&#8217;Flynn took the
hat from her hand. She gave it a quick glance,
then she looked at Patty.
</p>
<p>Had Patty looked more meek, had she seemed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
to await Miss O&#8217;Flynn&#8217;s opinion of her work,
the result might have been different.
</p>
<p>But Patty&#8217;s expression was so plainly that of
a conquering hero, she showed so palpably
her pride in her own achievement, that Miss
O&#8217;Flynn&#8217;s eyes narrowed, and her face hardened.
Without a word to Patty, she handed
the hat to a sad-eyed young woman at another
table, and said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Line this hat, Miss Harrigan.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; said the girl; and even as
Patty watched her, she began to snip deftly at
Patty&#8217;s small, careful stitches, and in a few moments
the lining was out, and the girl was
shaping and cutting a new one, with a quick,
sure touch, and with not so much as a glance in
Patty&#8217;s direction.
</p>
<p>The other girls,&mdash;the ones at Patty&#8217;s table,&mdash;looked
horrified, but they did not look openly
at Patty. Furtively, they darted glances at her
from beneath half-closed lids, and then as furtively
glanced at each other.
</p>
<p>It all struck Patty humorously. To have her
careful work discarded and snipped out, to be
replaced by &#8220;skilled labour,&#8221; seemed so funny
that she wanted to laugh aloud.
</p>
<p>But she was also deeply chagrined at her failure,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
and so it was an uncertain attitude of mind
that showed upon her face as Miss O&#8217;Flynn
again approached her.
</p>
<p>Without making any reference to the work
she had already done, Miss O&#8217;Flynn gave Patty
a hat frame and some thick, soft satin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cover the frame neatly, Miss Fairfield,&#8221;
was all she said, and walked away.
</p>
<p>Patty understood.
</p>
<p>It was her own independent and assured attitude
that had led Miss O&#8217;Flynn to pursue this
course. She didn&#8217;t for a moment think that all
beginners were treated like this. But she had
asked to be given a fair trial&mdash;and she was getting
it.
</p>
<p>Moreover, she half suspected that Miss
O&#8217;Flynn knew she was not really under the necessity
of earning her own living.
</p>
<p>Though wearing her plainest clothes, all the
details of her costume betokened an affluence
that couldn&#8217;t be concealed.
</p>
<p>Astute Patty began to think that Miss
O&#8217;Flynn saw through her, and that she was
cleverly getting even with her.
</p>
<p>However, she took the hat frame and the
satin, and set to work in thorough earnest.
Though not poor, she could not have tried any
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
harder to succeed had she been in direst want.
</p>
<p>But as to her work, she was very much at sea.
</p>
<p>She knew she had to get the satin on to the
frame, without crease or wrinkle. She knew
exactly how it ought to look when done, for she
had a hat of that sort herself, and the material
covered the foundation as creaselessly as paint.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure it only needs gumption,&#8221; thought
Patty, hopefully. &#8220;Here&#8217;s my real chance to
prove that it doesn&#8217;t need a series of lessons to
get some satin smoothly on a crinoline frame.
If I do it neatly, she won&#8217;t ask some other girl
to do it over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Paying no attention to the covert glances of
her companions, Patty set to work. She cut
carefully, she fitted neatly; she pinned and she
basted; she smoothed and she patted; and finally
she sewed, with tiny, close stitches, placed
evenly and with great precision.
</p>
<p>So absorbed did she become in her task that
she failed to notice the departure of the others
at noon. Alone she sat there at the table, snipping,
sewing, pinning, and patting the somewhat
refractory satin.
</p>
<p>It was almost one o&#8217;clock when she finished,
and looked up suddenly to see Miss O&#8217;Flynn
standing watching her.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why are you doing this?&#8221; she said to Patty,
as she took the hat from the girl&#8217;s hands.
</p>
<p>Patty sat up, all at once, conscious of great
pain in the back of her neck, from her continued
cramped position at work.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I want to earn money,&#8221; replied
Patty, not pertly, but in a tone of obstinate intent.
&#8220;Is it done right?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss O&#8217;Flynn looked at Patty, with an air of
kindliness and willingness to help her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me all about it,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>But Patty was in no mood for confidences, and
with a shade of hauteur in her manner, she
said again: &#8220;Is it done right? Does it suit
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>At Patty&#8217;s rejection of her advances, Miss
O&#8217;Flynn also became reserved again, and said,
simply: &#8220;I cannot use it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; demanded Patty. &#8220;It is covered
smoothly and neatly. It shows no crease
nor fold.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not right,&#8221; said Miss O&#8217;Flynn. &#8220;It is
not done right, because you do not know how to
do it. You have never been taught how to
cover hats or how to line them; consequently
you cannot do them right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The other girls had gone to luncheon, so the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
two were alone in the room. Patty knew that
Miss O&#8217;Flynn was telling her the truth, and yet
she resented it. A red spot burned in each cheek
as she answered:
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the hat is covered perfectly. What matter,
then, whether I have been taught or not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me, it is <i>not</i> covered perfectly. The
stitches are too small&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Too small!&#8221; exclaimed Patty. &#8220;Why, I
didn&#8217;t know stitches could be too <i>small</i>!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The other smiled. &#8220;That is my argument,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;You <i>don&#8217;t know</i>. Of course stitches
should be small for ordinary sewing, and for
many sorts of work. But not for millinery.
Here long stitches are wanted, but they must
be rightly set,&mdash;not careless long stitches.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; said Patty, somewhat subdued now.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because a better effect can be produced with
long stitches. You see, your stitches are small
and true, but every one shows. With a skilful
long stitch, no stitch is seen at all. It is what
we call a blind stitch, and can only be successfully
done by skilled workers, who have been
taught, and who have also had practice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty was silent a moment, then she said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss O&#8217;Flynn, we agreed that I was to have
a day&#8217;s trial.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Miss Fairfield; I will stand by my
word.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then may I select my own work for the
afternoon?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Miss O&#8217;Flynn, wondering
whether, after all, this pretty, young girl could
be a harmless lunatic.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I want to trim hats. Make bows, you
know; sew on flowers or feathers; or adjust
lace. May I do such things as that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss O&#8217;Flynn hesitated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, finally; &#8220;if you will be careful
not to injure the materials. You see, if your
work should have to be done over, I don&#8217;t want
the materials spoiled.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I promise,&#8221; said Patty, slowly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, first, will you not go out for your
lunch?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thank you; I&#8217;m not hungry. Please
bring me my work at once.&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>THREE HATS</h3>
</div>

<p>But Miss O&#8217;Flynn sent Patty a cup of hot
bouillon, and some biscuit, which she ate
right there at her work-table.
</p>
<p>And it was a kindly act, for, though Patty
didn&#8217;t realise it, she was really faint for want
of food and also for fresh air.
</p>
<p>The room, though large, had many occupants,
and now the girls began to come back from
their luncheon, and their chatter made Patty&#8217;s
head ache.
</p>
<p>But she was doing some deep thinking. Her
theories about unskilled labour had received a
hard blow; and she was beginning to think her
millinery efforts were not going to be successful.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ve a chance yet,&#8221; she thought, as Miss
O&#8217;Flynn came, bringing two hats, and a large
box of handsome trimmings.
</p>
<p>The other girls stared at this, for they knew
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
that Patty&#8217;s morning efforts had been far from
successful.
</p>
<p>But Patty only smiled at them in a pleasant,
but impersonal manner, as she took up her new
work.
</p>
<p>Her confidence returned. She knew she could
do what she was now about to attempt, for,
added to her natural taste and love of colour, she
had been critically interested in hats while in
Paris, and while visiting her friend, Lady Kitty,
who was especially extravagant in her millinery
purchases.
</p>
<p>After a period of thought, Patty decided on
her scheme of trimming for the two hats before
her, and then set blithely to work.
</p>
<p>One was to be a simple style of decoration, the
other, much more complicated. Taking up the
elaborate one first, Patty went at it with energy,
and with an assured touch, for she had the effect
definitely pictured in her imagination and
was sure she could materialise it.
</p>
<p>And she did. After about two hours&#8217; hard
work, Patty achieved a triumph. She held up
the finished hat, and every girl at the table
uttered an &#8220;ah!&#8221; of admiration at the beautiful
sight.
</p>
<p>Without response, other than a quiet smile,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
Patty took up the second hat. This was simple,
but daring in its very simplicity. A black velvet
Gainsborough, with broad, rolling brim. Patty
turned it smartly up, at one side, and fastened
it with a rosette of dull blue velvet and
a silver buckle. Just then, Miss O&#8217;Flynn
came in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did that hat come from?&#8221; she said,
pointing to Patty&#8217;s finished confection.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I trimmed it,&#8221; said Patty, nonchalantly.
&#8220;Have you some silver hatpins, Miss
O&#8217;Flynn?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You trimmed it!&#8221; exclaimed the forewoman,
ignoring Patty&#8217;s question, and taking up the
trimmed hat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; do you like it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a marvel! It looks like a French hat.
How did you know enough to trim it like
this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought it would look well that way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But these twists of velvet; they have a
touch!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; said Patty, inwardly exultant, but
outwardly calm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;this hat is of another
type.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not finished?&#8221; asked Miss O&#8217;Flynn,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
eyeing the hat in uncertainty, &#8220;and yet,&mdash;any
other trimming would spoil its lines.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so,&#8221; said Patty, placidly. &#8220;You see,
all it needs now, is two large silver hatpins, like
this,&mdash;see.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty pulled two hatpins from her own
hat, which she still had on, and placed
them carefully in the hat she held in her
hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;These pins are too small,&mdash;but you see what
I mean.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss O&#8217;Flynn did see. She saw that two
larger pins would finish the hat with just
the right touch, while any other decoration
would spoil it.
</p>
<p>She looked at Patty curiously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a genius, Miss Fairfield,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Will you trim another hat?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Patty, looking at her watch.
&#8220;It&#8217;s only four o&#8217;clock. May I have an evening
hat, please?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You may have whatever you like. Come and
select for yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty went to the cases, and chose a large
white beaver, with soft, broad brim.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will make you a picture hat, to put in your
window,&#8221; she said, smiling.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></p>
<p>She selected some trimmings and returned to
her seat at the table.
</p>
<p>It was rather more than half an hour later
when she showed Miss O&#8217;Flynn her work.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s not much work on it,&#8221; Patty said,
slowly. &#8220;I spent the time thinking it
out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was not much work on it, to be sure;
and yet it was a hat of great distinction.
</p>
<p>The white brim rolled slightly back, and where
it touched the low crown it met two immense
roses, one black and one of palest pink. Two
slight sprays of foliage, made of black velvet
leaves, nestled between the roses, and completed
the trimming.
</p>
<p>The roses were of abnormal size and great
beauty, but it was the mode of their adjustment
that secured the extremely <i>chic</i> effect.
</p>
<p>Miss O&#8217;Flynn&#8217;s eyes sparkled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a masterpiece,&#8221; she said, clasping her
hands in admiration. &#8220;You have trimmed hats
before, Miss Fairfield?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Patty, &#8220;but I always knew I
could do it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you can,&#8221; said Miss O&#8217;Flynn. &#8220;Will
you come now, and talk to Madame?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ushered into the presence of Madame Villard,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
Patty suddenly experienced a revulsion of feeling.
</p>
<p>Her triumph over Miss O&#8217;Flynn seemed small
and petty. She was conscious of a revolt against
the whole atmosphere of the place. The suavity
of Miss O&#8217;Flynn&#8217;s manner, the artificial grandeur
of Madame Villard, filled her with aversion,
and she wanted only to get away, and get
back to her own home.
</p>
<p>Not for any amount per week would she come
again to this dreadful place.
</p>
<p>She knew it was unreasonable; she knew that
if she were to earn her living it could not be in
a sheltered, luxurious home, but must, perforce,
be in some unattractive workroom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But rather a department store,&#8221; thought
poor Patty, &#8220;than in this place, with these
overdressed, overmannered women, who ape
fine ladies&#8217; manners.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty was overwrought and nervous. Her
long, hard day had worn her out, and it was no
wonder she felt a distaste for the whole thing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are certainly clever,&#8221; said Madame
Villard, patronisingly, as she looked at the hats
Miss O&#8217;Flynn held up for her inspection. &#8220;I
am glad to offer you a permanent position
here. You will have to learn the rudiments of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
the work, as the most gifted genius should always
be familiar with the foundations of his
own art. Will you agree to come to me every
day?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty hesitated. She hated the thought of
coming every day, even if but for a week. And
yet, here was the opportunity she was in search
of. Trimming hats was easy enough work;
probably they wouldn&#8217;t make her learn lining
and covering at once.
</p>
<p>Then the thought occurred to her that it
wouldn&#8217;t be honest to pretend she was coming
regularly, when she meant to do so only for a
week.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose I try it for a week,&#8221; she suggested.
&#8220;Then if either of us wishes to do so, we can
terminate the contract.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Madame, who thought to
herself she could make this young genius trim a
great many hats in a week. &#8220;Do you agree to
that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;At what salary?&#8221; asked Patty, faintly, for
she felt as if she were condemning herself to a
week of torture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Madame Villard, &#8220;as you are
so ignorant of the work, I ought not to give
you any recompense at all; but as you evince
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
such an aptitude for trimming I am willing to
say, five dollars a week.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Five dollars a week,&#8221; repeated Patty, slowly.
&#8220;You ought to be ashamed of yourself!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty did not mean to be rude or impertinent.
Indeed, for the moment she was not even thinking
of herself. She was thinking how a poor
girl, who had her living to earn, would feel at
an offer of five dollars for six long days of work
in that dreadful atmosphere.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; she said, mechanically,
and she said it more because of Madame Villard&#8217;s
look of amazement, than because of any
regret at her own blunt speech. &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t
have spoken so frankly. But the compensation
you offer is utterly inadequate.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty glanced at her watch, and then began
drawing on her gloves with an air of finality.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But wait,&mdash;wait, Miss Fairfield,&#8221; exclaimed
the Madame, who had no wish to let her new-found
genius thus slip away from her. &#8220;I like
your work. I may say I think it shows touches
of real talent. Also, you have unusually good
taste. In view of these things, I will overlook
still further your ignorance of the details of
the work, and I will give you seven dollars a
week.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Madame,&#8221; said Patty, &#8220;I am inexperienced
in the matter of wages, but I feel sure that you
either employ inferior workwomen or that you
underpay them. I don&#8217;t know which, but I
assure you that I could not think of accepting
your offer of seven dollars a week.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you come for ten?&#8221; asked Madame
Villard, eagerly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Patty, shortly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For twelve, then? This is my ultimate
offer, and you would do well to consider it carefully.
I have never paid so much to any workwoman,
and I offer it to you only because I
chance to like your style of work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And that is your ultimate offer?&#8221; said
Patty, looking at her squarely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and I am foolish to offer that; but, as
we agreed, it is only for one week, and so&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Spare your arguments, madame; I do not
accept your proposal. Twelve dollars a week is
not enough. And now, I will bid you good-afternoon.
Am I entitled to pay for my day&#8217;s
work?&#8221;
</p>
<p>With Patty&#8217;s final refusal, the manner of
Madame Villard had changed. No longer
placating and bland, she frowned angrily as
she said:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Pay, indeed! You should be charged for
the materials you spoiled in your morning&#8217;s
work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But in the afternoon,&#8221; said Patty, &#8220;I
trimmed three hats that will bring you big
profits.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing of the sort,&#8221; snapped Madame.
&#8220;The hats you trimmed are nothing of any moment.
Any of my girls could have done as
well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why don&#8217;t you pay them twelve dollars
a week?&#8221; cried Patty, whose harassed
nerves were making her irritable. &#8220;I will call
our financial account even, but if any of your
workwomen can trim hats that you like as well
as those that I trimmed, I trust you will give
them the salary you offered me. Good-afternoon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty bowed politely, and then, with a more
kindly bow and smile to Miss O&#8217;Flynn, she
went through the draperies, through the front
salesroom, and out at the front door. The
milliner and her forewoman followed her with
a dignified slowness, but reached the window in
time to see Patty get into an elaborately-appointed
motor-car which rolled rapidly away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s one of those society women who spy
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
out what wages we pay,&#8221; said Madame Villard,
with conviction.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s not old enough for that,&#8221; returned
Miss O&#8217;Flynn, &#8220;but she&#8217;s not looking for real
work, either. I can&#8217;t make her out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we have three stunning hats, anyway.
Put them in the window to-morrow. And you
may as well put Paris labels inside; they have
an air of the real thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>That evening Patty regaled her parents with
a truthful account of her day.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m &#8216;foiled again&#8217;!&#8221; she said, laughing.
&#8220;But the whole performance was so funny I
must tell you about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you have coaxed fifteen dollars a
week out of her?&#8221; asked Mr. Fairfield, after
Patty had told how Madame Villard&#8217;s price
had gradually increased.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, father, I was so afraid she <i>would</i> say
fifteen! Then I should have felt that I ought
to go to her for a week; for I may not get
another such chance. But I couldn&#8217;t live in that
place a week, I <i>know</i> I couldn&#8217;t!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked Nan, curiously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know exactly why,&#8221; returned Patty,
thoughtfully. &#8220;But it&#8217;s mostly because it&#8217;s all
so artificial and untrue. Miss O&#8217;Flynn talks as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
if she were a superior being; Madame Villard
talks as if she were a Royal personage. They
talk about their customers and each other in a
sort of make-believe grandiose way, that is as
sickening as it is absurd. I don&#8217;t know how to
express it, but I&#8217;d rather work in a place where
everybody is real, and claims only such honour
and glory as absolutely belong to them. I hate
pretence!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good little Patty!&#8221; said her father, heartily;
&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you do. Oh, I tell you, my girl,
you&#8217;ll learn some valuable lessons, even if you
don&#8217;t achieve your fifteen dollars.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I shall do that, too, father. You
needn&#8217;t think I&#8217;m conquered yet. Pooh!
What&#8217;s three failures to a determined nature
like mine?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What, indeed!&#8221; laughed Mr. Fairfield.
&#8220;Go ahead, my plucky little heroine; you&#8217;ll
strike it right yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I shall,&#8221; declared Patty, with such
a self-satisfied air of complacency that both her
hearers laughed.

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>THE THURSDAY CLUB</h3>
</div>

<p>As Patty was temporarily out of an &#8220;occupation,&#8221;
she went skating the next day
with the Farringtons and Kenneth. Indeed,
the four were so often together that they
began to call themselves the Quartette.
</p>
<p>After a jolly skate, which made their cheeks
rosy, they all went back to Patty&#8217;s, as they
usually did after skating.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you might come to my house, sometimes,&#8221;
said Elise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I have to go to Patty&#8217;s to look after the
goldfish,&#8221; said Kenneth. &#8220;I thought Darby
swam lame, the last time I saw him. Does he,
Patty?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not now. But Juliet has a cold, and I&#8217;m
afraid of rheumatism setting in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Kenneth; &#8220;she&#8217;s too young for
rheumatism. But she may have &#8216;housemaid&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
knee.&#8217; You must be very careful about
draughts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The goldfish were a never-failing source of
fun for the Quartette. The fish themselves
were quiet, inoffensive little creatures, but the
ready imagination of the young people invested
them with all sorts of strange qualities, both
physical and mental.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Juliet&#8217;s still sulky about that thimble,&#8221; said
Roger, as they all looked into the fishes&#8217; globe.
&#8220;I gave her Patty&#8217;s thimble yesterday to
wear for a hat, and it didn&#8217;t suit her at
all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say not!&#8221; cried Patty. &#8220;She
thought it was a helmet. You must take her for
Joan of Arc.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She didn&#8217;t wear a helmet,&#8221; said Elise, laughing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, she wore armour. They belong together.
Anyway, Juliet doesn&#8217;t know but that
Joan of Arc wore a helmet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, is that what made her so sulky?&#8221; said
Roger. &#8220;Nice disposition, I must say.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s nervous,&#8221; put in Kenneth, &#8220;and a little
morbid, poor thing. Patty, I think a little iron
in the water would do her good.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Send for a flatiron, Patty,&#8221; said Roger. &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
know it would help her, if you set it carefully
on top of her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t do it!&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;Poor Juliet is
flat enough now. She doesn&#8217;t eat enough to
keep a bird alive. Let&#8217;s go away and leave her
to sleep. That will fatten her, maybe.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lullaby, Julie, in the fish-bowl,&#8221; sang Roger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When the wind blows, the billows will roll,&#8221;
continued Elise, fanning the water in the globe
with a newspaper.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When the bowl breaks, the fishes will fall,&#8221;
contributed Patty, and Ken wound up by singing:
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the Cat will eat Juliet, Darby, and all!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, horrible!&#8221; cried Patty. &#8220;Indeed she
won&#8217;t! My beautiful pets shall never meet that
cruel fate.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Leaving Juliet to her much needed nap, they
all strolled into the library.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s be a club,&#8221; said Elise. &#8220;Just us four,
you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Patty, who loved clubs.
&#8220;What sort of a club?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Musical,&#8221; said Elise. &#8220;We all sing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Musical clubs are foolish,&#8221; said Roger.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s be a dramatic club.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dramatic clubs are too much work,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
Patty; &#8220;and four isn&#8217;t enough for that, anyway.
Let&#8217;s do good.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Patty,&#8221; groaned Kenneth, &#8220;you&#8217;re
getting so eleemosynary there&#8217;s no fun in
you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mercy, gracious!&#8221; cried Patty. &#8220;<i>What</i>
was that fearful word you said, Ken? No!
don&#8217;t say it over again! I can&#8217;t stand all of it
at once!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we have to stand you!&#8221; grumbled
Kenneth, &#8220;and you&#8217;re <i>that</i> all the time, now.
What foolishness are you going to fly at next,
trying to earn a dishonest penny?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking of going out as a cook,&#8221; said
Patty, her eyes twinkling. &#8220;Cooking is the
only thing I really know how to do. But I can
do that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be fine as cook,&#8221; said Roger. &#8220;May
I come round Thursday afternoons and take
you out?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose I&#8217;ll only have every other Thursday,&#8221;
said Patty, demurely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the other Thursday you won&#8217;t be
there! But what about this club we&#8217;re organising?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Make it musical,&#8221; said Kenneth, &#8220;and then
while one of us is playing or singing some
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
classical selection, the others can indulge in
merry conversation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You may as well make it the Patty Club,&#8221;
said Elise, &#8220;as I suppose it will always meet
here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Though not really jealous of her friend&#8217;s popularity,
Elise always resented the fact that the
young people would rather be at Patty&#8217;s than
at her own home.
</p>
<p>The reason was, that the Fairfield house,
though handsomely appointed, was not so formally
grand as the Farringtons&#8217;, and there was
always an atmosphere of cordiality and hospitality
at Patty&#8217;s, while at Elise&#8217;s it was oppressively
formal and dignified.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, pshaw,&#8221; said Patty, ignoring Elise&#8217;s unkind
intent; &#8220;I won&#8217;t have you always here.
We&#8217;ll take turns, of course.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Elise; &#8220;every other week at
my house and every other week here. But don&#8217;t
you think we ought to have more than four
members?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t,&#8221; declared Kenneth, promptly.
&#8220;And we don&#8217;t want any musical nonsense, or
any dramatic foolishness, either. Let&#8217;s just
have fun; if it&#8217;s pleasant weather, we&#8217;ll go skating,
or sleighing, or motoring, or whatever you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
like; if it isn&#8217;t, we&#8217;ll stay indoors, or go to a
matinée or concert, or something like that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lovely!&#8221; cried Elise. &#8220;But if we&#8217;re to go
to matinées, we&#8217;ll have to meet Saturdays.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Or Wednesdays,&#8221; amended Patty. &#8220;Let&#8217;s
meet Wednesdays. I &#8217;most always have engagements
on Saturdays.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right; shall we call it the Wednesday
Club, then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Elise,&#8221; said Roger, gravely. &#8220;That&#8217;s
too obvious; we will call it the Thursday Club,
because we meet on Wednesday; see?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t see,&#8221; said Elise, looking puzzled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; explained Roger, &#8220;you see we&#8217;ll
spend all day Thursday thinking over the good
time we had on Wednesday!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But that isn&#8217;t the real reason,&#8221; said Patty,
giggling. &#8220;The real reason we call it the
Thursday Club is because it meets on Wednesday!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it, Patsy!&#8221; said Ken, approvingly,
for he and Patty had the same love for nonsense,
though more practical Elise couldn&#8217;t always
understand it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, the Thursday Club will meet
here next Wednesday,&#8221; said Patty; &#8220;unless I
am otherwise engaged.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></p>
<p>For she just happened to think, that on that
day she might be again attempting to earn her
fifteen dollars.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the Thursday Club? Mayn&#8217;t I
belong?&#8221; said a pleasant voice, and Mr. Hepworth
came in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, how do you do?&#8221; cried Patty, jumping
up, and offering both hands. &#8220;I&#8217;m so glad to
see you. Do sit down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I came round,&#8221; said Mr. Hepworth, after
greeting the others, &#8220;in hopes I could corral
a cup of tea. I thought you ran a five-o&#8217;clock
tea-room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We do,&#8221; said Patty, ringing a bell nearby.
&#8220;That is, we always have tea when Nan is
home; and we can just as well have it when she
isn&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you young people don&#8217;t care for
tea,&#8221; went on Mr. Hepworth, looking a little
enviously at the merry group, who, indeed,
didn&#8217;t care whether they had tea or not.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, we do,&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;We love it.
But we,&mdash;we just forgot it. We were so engrossed
in organising a club.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But the others did not follow up this conversational
beginning, and even before the tea was
brought, Elise said she must go.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; said Patty; &#8220;don&#8217;t go yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Elise was decided, so away she went, and
of course, Roger went too.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m going,&#8221; said Kenneth, as Patty,
having followed Elise out into the hall, he
joined them there.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh; don&#8217;t you go, Ken,&#8221; said Patty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;d rather. When Hepworth comes
you get so grown-up all of a sudden.
With your &#8216;Oh, how do you do?&#8217; and your
<i>tea</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kenneth mimicked Patty&#8217;s voice, which did
sound different when she spoke to Mr. Hepworth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ken, you&#8217;re very unjust,&#8221; said Patty, her
cheeks flushing; &#8220;of course I have to give Mr.
Hepworth tea when he asks for it; and if I seem
more &#8216;grown-up&#8217; with him, it&#8217;s because he&#8217;s so
much older than you are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is, indeed! About twelve years older!
Too old to be your friend. He ought to be calling
on Mrs. Fairfield.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is. He calls on us both. I think you&#8217;re
very silly!&#8221;
</p>
<p>This conversation had been in undertones,
while Elise was donning her hat and furs, and
great was her curiosity when Patty turned from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
Kenneth, with an offended or hurt expression on
her face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you two?&#8221; she
asked, bluntly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; said Ken, looking humble.
&#8220;Patty&#8217;s been begging me to be more polite to
the goldfish.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; laughed Patty; &#8220;your manners
are above reproach, Ken.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks, fair lady,&#8221; he replied, with a Chesterfieldian
bow, and then the three went
away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I drive off your young friends, Patty?&#8221;
said Mr. Hepworth, as she returned to the
library, where Jane was already setting forth
the tea things.
</p>
<p>Patty was nonplussed. He certainly had driven
them away, but she couldn&#8217;t exactly tell him so.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t answer,&#8221; he said, laughing at
her dismayed expression. &#8220;I am sorry they
don&#8217;t like me, but until you show that you don&#8217;t,
I shall continue to come here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you will,&#8221; said Patty, earnestly. &#8220;It
isn&#8217;t that they don&#8217;t like you, Mr. Hepworth;
it&#8217;s that they think you don&#8217;t like them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t mean exactly that; but they think
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
that you think they&#8217;re children,&mdash;almost, and
you&#8217;re bored by them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not bored by you, and you&#8217;re a child,&mdash;almost.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know how it is,&#8221; said Patty,
throwing off all responsibility in the matter;
&#8220;but I like them and I like you, and yet, I&#8217;d
rather have you at different times.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Which do you like better?&#8221; asked Mr. Hepworth.
He knew it was a foolish question,
but it was uttered almost involuntarily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Them!&#8221; said Patty, but she gave him such
a roguish smile as she said it, that he almost
thought she meant the opposite.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Still,&#8221; she went on, with what was palpably
a mock regret, &#8220;I shall have to put up with
you for the present; so be as young as you can.
How many lumps, please?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Two; you see I can be very young.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Patty, approvingly; &#8220;it is young
to take two lumps. But now tell me something
about Miss Farley. Have you heard from her
or of her lately?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I have,&#8221; said Mr. Hepworth, as he
stirred his tea. &#8220;That is, I&#8217;ve heard of her.
My friend, down in Virginia, who knows Miss
Farley, has sent me another of her sketches, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
it proves more positively than ever that the girl
has real genius. But, Patty, I want you to give
up this scheme of yours to help her. It was
good of your father to make the offer he did,
but I don&#8217;t want you racing around to these
dreadful places looking for work. I&#8217;m going
to get some other people interested in Miss
Farley, and I&#8217;m sure her art education can be
managed in some way. I&#8217;d willingly subscribe
the whole sum needed, myself, but it would be
impossible to arrange it that way. She&#8217;d never
accept it, if she knew; and it&#8217;s difficult to deceive
her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty looked serious.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wonder you think I can&#8217;t do what I
set out to do,&#8221; she said slowly, &#8220;for I&#8217;ve made
so many ridiculous failures already. But please
don&#8217;t lose faith in me, yet. Give me one or two
more chances.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Hepworth looked kindly into Patty&#8217;s
earnest eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t take this thing too seriously,&#8221; he
said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I want to take it seriously. You think
I&#8217;m a child,&mdash;a butterfly. I assure you I am
neither.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;re adorable, whatever you are!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
was on the tip of Gilbert Hepworth&#8217;s tongue;
but he did not say it.
</p>
<p>Though he cared more for Patty than for anything
on earth, he had vowed to himself the
girl should never know it. He was thirty-five,
and Patty but eighteen, and he knew that was
too great a discrepancy in years for him ever
to hope to win her affections.
</p>
<p>So he contented himself with an occasional
evening call, or once in a while dropping in at
tea time, resolved never to show to Patty herself
the high regard he had for her.
</p>
<p>She had told him of her various unsuccessful
attempts at &#8220;earning her living,&#8221; and he deeply
regretted that he had been the means of bringing
about the situation.
</p>
<p>He did not share Mr. Fairfield&#8217;s opinion that
the experience was a good one for Patty, and
would broaden her views of humanity in general,
and teach her a few worth-while lessons.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please give up the notion,&#8221; he urged, after
they had talked the matter over.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed I won&#8217;t,&#8221; returned Patty. &#8220;At least,
not until I&#8217;ve proved to my own satisfaction
that my theories are wrong. And I don&#8217;t think
yet that they are. I still believe I can earn fifteen
dollars a week, without having had special
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
training for any work. Surely I ought to have
time to prove myself right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you ought to have time,&#8221; said Mr. Hepworth,
gently, &#8220;but you ought not to do it at
all. It&#8217;s an absurd proposition, the whole thing.
And as I, unfortunately, brought it about, I
want to ask you, please, to drop it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir!&#8221; said Patty, gravely, but wagging
a roguish forefinger at him; &#8220;people can&#8217;t undo
their mistakes so easily. If, as you say, you
brought about this painful situation, then you
must sit patiently by and watch me as I flounder
about in the various sloughs of despond.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Patty, don&#8217;t! Please drop it all,&mdash;for
my sake!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty looked up in surprise at his earnest tones,
but she only laughed gaily, and said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nixy! Not I! Not by no means! But I&#8217;ll
give in to this extent. I&#8217;ll agree not to make
more than three more attempts. If I can&#8217;t succeed
in three more efforts, I&#8217;ll give up the game,
and confess myself a butterfly and an idiot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The only symptoms of idiocy are shown in
your making three more attempts,&#8221; said Mr.
Hepworth, who was almost angry at Patty&#8217;s
persistence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, pooh! I probably shan&#8217;t make three
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
more! I just somehow feel sure I&#8217;ll succeed
the very next time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A sanguine idiot is the most hopeless sort,&#8221;
said Mr. Hepworth, with a resigned air. &#8220;May
I ask what you intend to attempt next?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You may ask, but you can&#8217;t be answered, for
I don&#8217;t yet know, myself. I&#8217;ve two or three
tempting plans, but I don&#8217;t know which to
choose. I&#8217;ve thought of taking a place as
cook.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty! don&#8217;t you dare do such a thing! To
think of you in a kitchen,&mdash;under orders! Oh,
child, how <i>can</i> you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty laughed outright at Mr. Hepworth&#8217;s
dismay.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cheer up!&#8221; she cried; &#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean it!
But you think skilled labour is necessary, and
truly, I&#8217;m skilled in cooking. I really am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, chafing-dish trifles; and fancy desserts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, those are good things for a cook to
know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty, promise me you won&#8217;t take any sort of
a servant&#8217;s position.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I can&#8217;t promise that. I fancy I&#8217;d make
a rather good lady&#8217;s-maid or parlour-maid. But
I promise you I won&#8217;t be a cook. Much as I
like to fuss with a chafing-dish, I shouldn&#8217;t like
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
to be kept in a kitchen and boil and roast things
all the time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say not! Well, since I can&#8217;t persuade
you to give up your foolish notion, do go
on, and get through with your three attempts as
soon as possible. Remember, you&#8217;ve promised
not more than three.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I promise,&#8221; said Patty, with much solemnity,
and then Nan and Mr. Fairfield came in.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hepworth appealed at once to Mr. Fairfield,
telling him what he had already told
Patty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense, Hepworth,&#8221; said Patty&#8217;s father,
&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you started the ball rolling. It
hasn&#8217;t done Patty a bit of harm, so far, and it
will be an experience she&#8217;ll always remember.
Let her go ahead; she can&#8217;t succeed, but she
can have the satisfaction of knowing she tried.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure she can&#8217;t succeed,&#8221; said Nan,
standing up for Patty, who looked a little crestfallen
at the remarks of her father.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good for you, Nan!&#8221; cried Patty; &#8220;I&#8217;ll
justify your faith in me yet. I know Mr. Hepworth
thinks I&#8217;m good for nothing, but Daddy
ought to know me better.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Hepworth seemed not to notice this petulant
outburst, and only said:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Remember, you&#8217;ve promised to withdraw
from the arena after three more conflicts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t be conflicts,&#8221; said Patty, &#8220;and
there won&#8217;t be but one, anyway!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So much the better,&#8221; said Mr. Hepworth,
calmly.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>MRS. VAN REYPEN</h3>
</div>

<p>It was about a week later. Nothing further
had been said or done in the matter of
Patty&#8217;s &#8220;occupation,&#8221; and Mr. and Mrs.
Fairfield wondered what plan was slowly brewing
under the mop of golden curls.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hepworth began to hope his words had
had an effect after all, and was about to lay the
case of Miss Farley before some other true and
tried friends.
</p>
<p>But he had practically promised Patty to give
her time for three more attempts; so he waited.
</p>
<p>One day Patty came into the house just in
time for luncheon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nan,&#8221; she said, as they sat down at the
table, &#8220;I&#8217;ve struck it right this time!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>In</i>-deed!&#8221; said Nan, raising her eyebrows,
quizzically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I have! You needn&#8217;t laugh like that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t laugh.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you did,&mdash;behind your eyes, but I saw
you! Now, as I tell you, this time conquers!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good for you, Patsy! Let me congratulate
you. Let me do it now, lest I shouldn&#8217;t be able
to do it later.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh! I thought you had faith in me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And so I have, Patty girl,&#8221; said Nan, growing
serious all at once. &#8220;I truly have. Also,
I&#8217;ll help you, if I can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just it, Nan. You can help me this
time, and I&#8217;m going to tell you all about it, before
I start in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to tell me now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, because I go this afternoon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go where?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just it. I go to take a position as a
companion to an elderly lady. And I shall stay
a week. I&#8217;ll take some clothes in a suitcase, or
small trunk, and after I&#8217;m gone, you must tell
father, and make it all right with him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Patty, he said at the outset, you must
be home by five o&#8217;clock every day, whatever
you were doing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; but that referred to occupations by the
day. Now, that I&#8217;ve decided to take this sort
of a position, which is really more appropriate
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
to a lady of my &#8216;social standing,&#8217; you must explain
to him that I can&#8217;t come home at five
o&#8217;clock, because I have to stay all the time,
nights and all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty, you&#8217;re crazy!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not. I&#8217;m determined; I&#8217;m even
stubborn, if you like; but I&#8217;m <i>going</i>! So, that&#8217;s
settled. Now, you said you&#8217;d help me. Are
you going to back out?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I&#8217;m not. But I can&#8217;t approve of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you can, if you try hard enough. Just
think how much properer it is for me to be companion
to a lovely lady in her own house, than
to be racing around lower Broadway for patchwork!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; said Nan, and then she realised
that if she knew where Patty was going, they
could go and bring her home at any time, if
Mr. Fairfield wished.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;who&#8217;s your lovely
lady?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Van Reypen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty Fairfield! Not <i>the</i> Mrs. Van Reypen?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, the very one! Isn&#8217;t it gay? She&#8217;s a
bit eccentric, and she advertised for a companion,
saying the application must be a written
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
one. So I pranced up to her house this morning,
and secured the position.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But she said to apply by letter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; that&#8217;s why I went myself! I sent up
my card, and a message that I had come in answer
to her advertisement. She sent back word
that I could go home and write to her. I said
I&#8217;d write then and there. So I helped myself to
her library desk, and wrote out a regular application.
In less than five minutes, I was summoned
to her august presence, and after looking
me over, she engaged me at once. How&#8217;s that
for quick action?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But does she know who you are?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, she knows my name, and that&#8217;s all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But she&#8217;s a,&mdash;why, she&#8217;s sort of an institution.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I know she&#8217;s a public benefactor, and
all that. But, really, she&#8217;s very interesting;
though, I fancy she has a quick temper. However,
we&#8217;ve made the agreement for a week.
Then if either of us wants to back out, we&#8217;re at
liberty to do so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She was willing to arrange it that way?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She insisted on it. She never takes anybody
until after a week&#8217;s trial.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are your duties?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, almost nothing. I&#8217;m not a social secretary,
or anything like that. Merely a companion,
to be with her, and read to her occasionally,
or perhaps sing to her, and go to drive
with her,&mdash;and that&#8217;s about all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No one else in the family?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so. She didn&#8217;t speak of any
one, except her secretary and servants. She&#8217;s
rather old-fashioned, and the house is dear.
All crystal chandeliers, and old frescoed walls
and ceilings, and elaborate door-frames. Why,
Nan, it&#8217;ll be fun to be there a week, and it&#8217;s so,&mdash;well,
so safe and pleasant, you know, and so
correct and seemly. Why, if I really had to
earn my own living, I couldn&#8217;t do better than
to be companion to Mrs. Van Reypen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I suppose not. What is the salary?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s the beauty of it! It&#8217;s just fifteen
dollars a week. And as I get &#8216;board and lodging&#8217;
beside, I&#8217;m really doing better than I
agreed to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like it, Patty,&#8221; said Nan, after a few
moments&#8217; thought. &#8220;But it&#8217;s better, in some
ways, than the other things you&#8217;ve done. Go
on, and I&#8217;ll truly do all I can to talk your father
into letting you stay there a week; but if he
won&#8217;t consent, I can&#8217;t help it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why, of course he&#8217;ll consent, Nan, if you
put it to him right. You can make him see anything
as you see it, if you try. You know you
can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, go ahead. I suppose a week will pass;
and anyway, you&#8217;ll probably come flying home
after a couple of days.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I&#8217;m going to stay the week, if it finishes
me. I&#8217;m tired of defeats; this time I conquer.
You may help me pack, if you like.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t need many frocks, will you?&#8221;
said Nan, as they went up to Patty&#8217;s room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; just some light, dressy things for evening,&mdash;she&#8217;s
rather formal,&mdash;and some plain
morning gowns.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nan helped Patty with her selection, and a
small trunk was filled with what they considered
an appropriate wardrobe for a companion.
</p>
<p>At about four o&#8217;clock Patty started, in the
motor-car.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Van Reypen received her pleasantly, and
as they sat chatting over a cup of tea, Patty felt
more like an honoured guest than a subordinate.
</p>
<p>Then Mrs. Van Reypen dismissed her, saying:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go to your room now, my dear, and occupy
yourself as you choose until dinner-time. Dinner
is at seven. There will be no guests, but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
you will wear a light, pretty gown, if you please.
I am punctilious in such matters.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty went to her room, greatly pleased with
the turn events had taken. She wished she
could telephone home how pleasantly she was
getting along; but she thought wiser not to do
that so soon.
</p>
<p>As it neared dinner-time, she put on one of her
prettiest dresses, a light blue chiffon, with a
touch of silver embroidery round the half-low
throat and short sleeves.
</p>
<p>A few minutes before seven, she went slowly
down the dark, old staircase, with its massive
newels and balusters.
</p>
<p>As she reached the middle steps, she observed
an attractive, but bored-looking young man in
the hall.
</p>
<p>He had not noticed her light steps, and Patty
paused a moment to look at him. As she stood,
wondering who he might be, he chanced to turn,
and saw her.
</p>
<p>The young man ran his eyes swiftly, from the
cloud of blue chiffon, up to the smiling face,
with its crown of massed golden hair, which a
saucy bow of blue ribbon did its best to hold in
place.
</p>
<p>His face promptly lost its bored expression,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
and with his hands still in his pockets, he involuntarily
breathed a long, low whistle.
</p>
<p>The sound seemed to bring back his lost wits,
and quickly drawing his hands into view, he
stepped forward, saying:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon for that unconventional
note of admiration, but I trust you will accept
it as the tribute for which it was meant.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was an easy opening, and Patty was quite
ready to respond gaily, when she suddenly remembered
her position in the house and wondered
if a companion ought to speak to a strange
young man in the same language a young person
in society might use.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she said, uncertainly, and her
shy hesitation completely captured the heart of
Philip Van Reypen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on down; I won&#8217;t eat you,&#8221; he said,
reassuringly. &#8220;You are, I assume, a guest of
my aunt&#8217;s.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Mrs. Van Reypen&#8217;s companion,&#8221; said
Patty, but though she made the announcement
demurely enough, the funny side of it all struck
her so forcibly that she had difficulty to keep
the corners of her mouth from showing her
amusement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By Jove!&#8221; exclaimed the young man,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
&#8220;Aunty Van always is lucky! Now, I&#8217;m her
nephew.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Does that prove her good luck?&#8221; said Patty,
unable to be prim in the face of this light gaiety.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed! Come on down, and get acquainted,
and you&#8217;ll agree with me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe I ought to,&#8221; said Patty, hesitatingly
placing one little satin-slippered foot on
the next step below, and then pausing again.
&#8220;You see, I&#8217;ve never been a companion before,
but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s right for me to precede
Mrs. Van Reypen into the drawing-room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, well, perhaps not. Stay on the stairs,
then, if you think that&#8217;s the proper place. I
daresay it is,&mdash;I never was a companion, either;
so I&#8217;m not sure. But sit down, won&#8217;t you? I&#8217;ll
sit here, if I may.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Young Van Reypen dropped onto a stair a few
steps below Patty, who sat down, too, feeling
decidedly at her ease, for, upon occasion, a staircase
was one of her favourite haunts.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like a party,&#8221; she said, smiling. &#8220;I love
to sit on a staircase at a party, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>And so provocative of sociability did the staircase
prove, that when Mrs. Van Reypen came
down, in all the glory of her black velvet and
old lace, she nearly tumbled over two chatting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
young people, who seemed to be very good
friends.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Philip! You here?&#8221; she exclaimed, and a
casual observer would have said she was not
too well pleased.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Aunty Van; aren&#8217;t you as glad to see
me as I am to see you? I&#8217;ve been making Miss
Fairfield&#8217;s acquaintance. You may introduce
us if you like, but it isn&#8217;t really necessary.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So it seems,&#8221; said the old lady, drily; &#8220;but
as I have some regard for the conventions, I
will present to you, Miss Fairfield, my scape-grace
and ne&#8217;er-do-well nephew, Philip Van
Reypen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What an awful reputation to live up to,&#8221;
said Patty, smiling at the debonair Philip, who
quite looked the part his aunt assigned to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Awful, but not at all difficult,&#8221; he responded,
gaily, and Patty followed as he escorted his
aunt to the dining-room.
</p>
<p>The little dinner-party was a gay one; Mrs.
Van Reypen became mildly amiable under the
influence of the young people&#8217;s merry chatter,
and Patty felt that so far, at least, a companion&#8217;s
lot was not such a very unhappy one.
</p>
<p>After dinner, however, the young man was
sent peremptorily away. He begged to stay,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
but his aunt ordered him off, declaring that she
had seen enough of him, and he was not to return
for a week at least. Philip went away,
sulkily, declaring that he would call the very
next morning to inquire after his aunt&#8217;s health.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I trust you are not flirtatiously inclined, Miss
Fairfield,&#8221; said Mrs. Van Reypen, as the two
sat alone in the large and rather sombre drawing-room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not,&#8221; said Patty, honestly. &#8220;I like gay
and merry conversation, but as your companion,
I consider myself entirely at your orders, and
have no mind to chatter if you do not wish me
to do so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is right,&#8221; said Mrs. Van Reypen, approvingly.
&#8220;You cannot have many friends in
your present position, of course. And you must
not feel flattered at Mr. Philip&#8217;s apparent admiration
of you. He is a most impressionable
youth, and is caught by every new face he sees.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty smiled at the idea of her being unduly
impressed by Mr. Van Reypen&#8217;s glances. She
had given him no thought, save as a good-natured,
well-bred young man.
</p>
<p>But she pleasantly assured Mrs. Van Reypen
that she would give her nephew no further consideration,
and though Mrs. Van Reypen looked
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
sharply at Patty&#8217;s face, she saw only an honest
desire to please her employer.
</p>
<p>The evening was long and uninteresting.
</p>
<p>At Mrs. Van Reypen&#8217;s request, Patty read to
her, and then sang for her.
</p>
<p>But the lady was critical, and declared that the
reading was too fast, and the singing too loud,
so that when at last it was bedtime, Patty wondered
whether she was giving satisfaction or not.
</p>
<p>But she was engaged for a week, anyway, and
whether satisfactory or not, Mrs. Van Reypen
must keep her for that length of time, and that
was all Patty wanted.
</p>
<p>She woke next morning with a pang of homesickness.
It was a bit forlorn, to wake up as a
hired companion, instead of as a beloved daughter
in her own father&#8217;s house.
</p>
<p>But resolutely putting aside such thoughts, she
forced herself to think of her good fortune in
securing her present position.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m here!&#8221; she assured herself, as
she dashed cold water into her suspiciously reddened
eyes. &#8220;I know I shall have all sorts of
odd and interesting adventures here; and I&#8217;m
determined to be happy whatever happens.
And, anyway, it will be over soon. A week isn&#8217;t
long.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></p>
<p>Putting on a trim morning dress, of soft old
rose cashmere, with a fine embroidered white
yoke, she went sedately down to the breakfast
room. She had been told to come to breakfast
at nine o&#8217;clock, and the clock struck the hour
just as she crossed the threshold.
</p>
<p>Instead of her employer, she was astounded
to see Philip Van Reypen calmly seated at the
table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jolly to see you again!&#8221; he cried, as he
jumped up to greet her. &#8220;Just thought I&#8217;d run
in for a bite of breakfast, and to inquire how
Aunty Van&#8217;s cold is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know she had a cold,&#8221; said Patty,
primly, trying to act as she thought a companion
ought to act.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither did I,&#8221; said the irrepressible Philip.
&#8220;But I didn&#8217;t know but she might have caught
one in the night. A germ flying in at the window,
or something.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mindful of Mrs. Van Reypen&#8217;s admonitions,
Patty tried not to appear interested in the
young man&#8217;s remarks, but it was impossible
to ignore the fact that he was interested in
her.
</p>
<p>She responded to his gay banter in monosyllables,
and kept her dancing eyes veiled by their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
own long-fringed lids, but this only served to
pique Philip&#8217;s curiosity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a notion to spend the day here, with
Aunty Van,&#8221; he said, and then Patty glanced
up at him in positive alarm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t!&#8221; she cried, and her face betokened a
genuine distress.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; said the surprised young man;
&#8220;have you learned to dislike me so cordially
already?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Amiable Patty couldn&#8217;t stand for this misinterpretation
of her attitude, and her involuntary,
smiling glance was a sufficient disclaimer.
</p>
<p>But she was saved the necessity of a verbal
reply, for just at that moment Mrs. Van
Reypen came into the room.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>PERSISTENT PHILIP</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Why, Philip!&#8221; Mrs. Van Reypen exclaimed;
&#8220;you are indeed growing
attentive to your aged aunt!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Middle-aged aunt!&#8221; he returned, gallantly;
&#8220;and belonging to the early middle-ages at
that! I told you I should call this morning, and
I&#8217;d like another egg, please, aunty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You may have all the eggs you want, but I
am not at all pleased with your presence here
after I expressly forbade it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it isn&#8217;t a crime to call on one&#8217;s own
aunt, is it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s extremely rude. I have a busy day before
me, and I don&#8217;t want a bothersome nephew
around.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Van Reypen was exceedingly fond of
Philip, and loved to have him at her house, but
it was easy to be seen, now, that she considered
him far too much interested in pretty Patty.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></p>
<p>And partly because he was interested, and
partly to tease his long-suffering aunt, the young
man declared his intention of spending the day
with them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t have you, Philip,&#8221; said Mrs. Van
Reypen, decidedly. &#8220;I want you to go away
immediately after breakfast.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just my luck!&#8221; grumbled her nephew. &#8220;I
never can do anything I want to. Well, I&#8217;ll go
downtown, but I&#8217;ll be back here to luncheon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk nonsense,&#8221; said Mrs. Van Reypen,
shortly; &#8220;you&#8217;ll do nothing of the sort.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The rest of the meal was not very enjoyable.
Mrs. Van Reypen was clearly displeased at her
nephew&#8217;s presence; Patty did not think it wise
to take any active part in the conversation; and,
though Philip was in gay spirits, it was not easy
to be merry alone.
</p>
<p>Patty couldn&#8217;t help smiling at his audacious
speeches, but she kept her eyes down on her
plate, and endeavoured to ignore the young
man&#8217;s presence, for she knew this was what
Mrs. Reypen wished her to do.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you may go,&#8221; said the hostess, as
Philip finished his egg. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to enjoy a
cup of coffee in peace.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m peaceful!&#8221; declared Philip, crossing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
his hands on his breast and rolling up his
eyes with an angelic expression.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by, Philip,&#8221; said his aunt, so icily that
the young man rose from the table and stalked
out of the room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Mrs. Van Reypen, &#8220;we are rid
of him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But in a few moments the smiling face again
appeared at the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I forgot to say good-by to Miss Fairfield,&#8221;
he announced, cheerfully. &#8220;Mayn&#8217;t I do that,
aunty?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Van Reypen gave an annoyed &#8220;Humph!&#8221;
and Patty, taking her cue, bowed very coldly,
and said &#8220;Good-morning, Mr. Van Reypen&#8221;
in an utterly impersonal tone.
</p>
<p>Philip chuckled, and went away, slamming the
street door behind him, as a final annoyance
to his aunt.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t think him a rude boy, Miss
Fairfield,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But he delights to tease
me, and unless I am positively cross to him he
never lets up. But he is really devoted to me,
and, I assure you, he scarcely noted your presence
at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; said Patty, with great difficulty
restraining a burst of laughter. &#8220;No one
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
could dream of Mr. Philip Van Reypen observing
a companion.&#8221; Patty did not mean this
for sarcasm; she desired only to set Mrs. Van
Reypen&#8217;s mind at rest, and then the subject of
Philip was dropped.
</p>
<p>Soon after breakfast Mrs. Van Reypen conducted
Patty to a pleasant morning room, and
asked her to read the newspaper aloud.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And do try to read slower,&#8221; she added. &#8220;I
hate rapid gabbling.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty had resolved not to take offence at the
brusque remarks, which she knew would be
hurled at her, so, somewhat meekly, she took
up the paper and began.
</p>
<p>It was a trying task. If she read an account
of anything unpleasant she was peremptorily
stopped; if the news was dry or prosy, that
was also cut off short.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Read me the fashion notes,&#8221; said Mrs. Van
Reypen, at last.
</p>
<p>So Patty read a whole page about the latest
modes, and her hearer was greatly interested.
</p>
<p>She then told Patty of some new gowns she
was having made, and seemed pleased at Patty&#8217;s
intelligent comments on them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you have good taste!&#8221; she exclaimed,
as if making a surprising discovery. &#8220;I will
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
take you with me this afternoon when I go to
Madame Leval&#8217;s to try on my gowns.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;And now, Mrs.
Van Reypen, I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s nothing more of
interest in the paper; what shall I do next?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Heavens! Miss Fairfield, don&#8217;t ask such a
question as that! You are here to entertain me.
I am not to provide amusement for you! Why
do you suppose I have you here, if not to make
my time pass pleasantly?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty was bewildered at this outburst. Though
she knew her duties would be light, she supposed
they would be clearly defined, and not left to
her own invention.
</p>
<p>But she was anxious to please, and she said,
pleasantly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that&#8217;s really what I meant, but I
didn&#8217;t express myself very well. And, you see,
I don&#8217;t yet quite know your tastes. Do you like
fancy work? I know a lovely new crochet
stitch I could show you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I hate crocheting. The wool gets all
snarled up, and the pattern gets wrong every
few stitches.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll dismiss that. Do you like to play
cards? I know cribbage, and some other games
that two can play.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No; I detest cards. I think it is very foolish
to sit and fumble with bits of painted pasteboard!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Poor Patty was at her wits&#8217; end. She had not
expected to be a professional entertainer, and
she didn&#8217;t know what to suggest next.
</p>
<p>She felt sure Mrs. Van Reypen wouldn&#8217;t care
to listen to any more reading just then. She
hesitated to propose music, as it had not been
very successful the night before. On a sudden
impulse, she said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you like to see dancing? I can do some
pretty fancy dances.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It seemed an absurd thing to say, but Patty
had ransacked her brain to think what professional
entertainers did, and that was all she
could think of, except recitations, and those she
hated herself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I do!&#8221; cried Mrs. Van Reypen, so emphatically
that Patty jumped. &#8220;I love to see
dancing! If you can do it, which I doubt, I
wish you would dance for me. And this evening
we&#8217;ll go to see that new dancer that the town
is wild over. If you really can dance, you&#8217;ll
appreciate it as I do. To me dancing is a fine
art, and should be considered so&mdash;but it rarely
is. Do you require music?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, I prefer it, but I can dance
without.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll try it without, first; then, if I wish to,
I&#8217;ll ask Delia, my parlour-maid, to play for you.
She plays fairly well. Or, if it suits me, I may
play myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty made no response to these suggestions,
but followed Mrs. Van Reypen to the great
drawing-room, at one end of which was a grand
piano.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Try it without music, first,&#8221; was the order,
and Patty walked to the other end of the long
room, while Mrs. Van Reypen seated herself on
a sofa. Serenely conscious of her proficiency in
the art, Patty felt no embarrassment, and, swaying
gently, as if listening to rhythm, she began
a pretty little fancy dance that she had learned
some years ago.
</p>
<p>She danced beautifully, and she loved to dance,
so she made a most effective picture, as she
pirouetted back and forth, or from side to side
of the long room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Beautiful!&#8221; said Mrs. Van Reypen, as Patty
paused in front of her and bowed. &#8220;You are
a charming dancer. I don&#8217;t know when I&#8217;ve
enjoyed anything so much. Are you tired? Will
you dance again?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not at all tired,&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;I like
to dance, and I&#8217;m very glad it pleases you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you do a minuet?&#8221; asked the old lady,
after Patty had finished another dance, a gay
little Spanish fandango.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; but I like music for that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good! I will play myself.&#8221; With great
dignity, Mrs. Van Reypen rose and walked to
the piano.
</p>
<p>Patty adjusted the music-stool for her, and she
ran her delicate old fingers lightly over the
keys.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sadly out of practice,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but I
can play a tinkling minuet and you may dance
to it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She began a melodious little air, and Patty,
after listening a moment, nodded her head, and
ran to take her place.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Van Reypen was so seated at the piano
that she could watch Patty&#8217;s dance, and in a
moment the two were in harmony, and Patty
was gliding and bowing in a charming minuet,
while Mrs. Van Reypen played in perfect
sympathy.
</p>
<p>The dance was nearly over when Patty discovered
the smiling face of Mr. Philip Van
Reypen in the doorway.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></p>
<p>His aunt could not see him, and Patty saw
only his reflection in the mirror. He gave her
a pleading glance, and put his finger on his lip,
entreating her silence.
</p>
<p>So she went on, without seeming to see him.
But she wondered what his aunt would say
after the dance was over.
</p>
<p>Indeed, the funny side of the situation struck
her so forcibly that she unconsciously smiled
broadly at her own thoughts.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; said Mrs. Van Reypen, as the
dancing and music both came to an end; &#8220;I am
glad to see you smile as you dance. I have seen
some dancers who look positively agonised as
they do difficult steps.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty smiled again, remembering that she had
had a reason to smile as she danced, and she
wondered why Philip didn&#8217;t appear.
</p>
<p>But he didn&#8217;t, and, except that she had seen
him so clearly in the mirror, and he had asked
her, silently but unmistakably, not to divulge the
fact of his presence, she would have thought
she only imagined him there in the doorway.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You dance wonderfully well,&#8221; went on Mrs.
Van Reypen. &#8220;You have had very good training.
I shall be glad to have you dance for me
often. But&mdash;and please remember this&mdash;never
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
when any one else is here. I wish you to dance
for me only. If I have guests, or if my nephew
is here, you are not to dance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was almost too much for Patty&#8217;s gravity.
For she well knew the old lady was foolishly
alarmed lest her nephew should fall in love with
a humble &#8220;companion,&#8221; and, knowing that the
said nephew had gleefully watched the dance,
it was difficult not to show her amusement.
</p>
<p>But she only said, &#8220;I will remember, Mrs.
Van Reypen.&#8221; She couldn&#8217;t tell of the intruder
after his frantic appeal to her for silence,
so she determined to ignore the episode.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, you may do as you like until luncheon
time,&#8221; said Mrs. Van Reypen, &#8220;for I shall go
to my room and lie down for a rest. My maid
will attend me, so I will bid you adieu until one
o&#8217;clock. Wander round the house if you
choose. You will find much to interest you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Right you are!&#8221; thought Patty to herself.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe I&#8217;d have to wander far to find
a jolly comrade to interest me!&#8221; But she well
knew if Mr. Philip Van Reypen was still in
the house, and if she should encounter him and
chat with him, it would greatly enrage the old
lady.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; thought Patty, &#8220;since I&#8217;ve made good
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
with my dancing it&#8217;s a shame to spoil my
record by talking to Sir Philip. But he is
pleasant.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Determined to do her duty, she went straight
to her own room, though tempted to &#8220;wander
round the house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And sure enough, though she didn&#8217;t know it,
Mr. Van Reypen was watching her from behind
the drawing-room draperies. His face fell as
he saw her go up the stairs, and, though he
waited some time, she did not return.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Saucy Puss!&#8221; he thought. &#8220;But I&#8217;ll have
a chat with her yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Going to the library he scribbled a note, and
sent it by a servant to Miss Fairfield&#8217;s room.
The note said:
</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;Do come down and talk to a lonely, neglected
waif, if only for a few minutes.
</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style='text-align: right; '>&#8220;P. V. R.&#8221;</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>Patty laughed as she read it, but she only said
to the maid who brought it:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please say to Mr. Van Reypen that there
is no answer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The maid departed, but, in less than ten minutes,
returned with another note:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re afraid of Aunty Van! Come on. I
will protect you. Just for a few moments&#8217; chat
on the stairs.
</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style='text-align: right; '>&#8220;P. V. R.&#8221;</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>Again Patty sent the message, &#8220;There is no
answer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Soon came a third note:
</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;I think you are horrid! And you don&#8217;t dance
prettily at all!&#8221;
</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Oho!&#8221; thought Patty. &#8220;Getting saucy, is
he?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She made no response whatever to the maid
this time, but she was not greatly surprised
when another note came:
</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t come down, I&#8217;m going out to
drown myself. P.&#8221;
</p>
</div>
<p>Patty began to be annoyed. The servants
must think all this very strange, and yet surely
she could not help it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a moment, Delia,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Please
say to Mr. Van Reypen that I will see him in
the library, at once.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></p>
<p>After a moment she followed the maid
downstairs, and went straight to the library,
where the young man awaited her. His face
lighted up with gladness, as he held out his
hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Forgive me if I was impertinent,&#8221; he said,
with such a charming air of apology that Patty
had to smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I forgive the impertinence,&#8221; she returned,
&#8220;but you are making real trouble for
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; he cried, looking
dismayed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean that I am your aunt&#8217;s companion,
and trying to earn my living thereby. Now if
you persist in secretly coming to the house,&mdash;pardon
me if I am frank,&mdash;and if you persist
in sending foolish notes to me, your aunt will
not let me stay here, and I shall lose a good
position through your unkindness.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty was very much in earnest, and her words
were sincere, but her innate sense of humour
couldn&#8217;t fail to see the ridiculous side of
it all, and the corners of her mouth dimpled
though she kept her eyes resolutely cast
down.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a shame the way she keeps you tied to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
her apron string,&#8221; he blurted out, uncertain
whether Patty was coquetting, or really
distressed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;I&#8217;m here to attend
on her pleasure, and my place is by her
side whenever she wants me there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How can any one help wanting you there?&#8221;
broke out Philip, so explosively that Patty, instead
of being offended, burst into a ringing
laugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you are too funny!&#8221; she exclaimed.
&#8220;Mrs. Van Reypen said you were given to saying
things like that to everybody.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t say them to everybody!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you do; your aunt says so. But now
that you&#8217;ve said it to me, won&#8217;t you go away
and stay away?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How long?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty thought quickly. &#8220;Till next Friday&mdash;a
week from to-day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you want to get acclimatised, all by
yourself!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Patty, demurely, &#8220;I do. And if
you&#8217;ll only keep away,&mdash;you know your aunt
asked you not to come back for a week,&mdash;if
you&#8217;ll keep away till next Friday, I&#8217;ll never ask
you another favour.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Huh! that&#8217;s no inducement. I love to have
you ask me favours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, I never shall if you don&#8217;t grant
this first one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And if I do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you do I&#8217;ll promise you almost anything
you ask.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a large order! Well, if I stay away
from this house until you get solid with Aunty
Van&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I said a week.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, to-day&#8217;s Friday. If I stay away a week
will you persuade aunty to invite me to dinner
next Friday night?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you persuade her to do that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I can by that time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty&#8217;s eyes were dancing. She had come to
Mrs. Van Reypen&#8217;s on Thursday. She would,
therefore, leave on Thursday, and she was sure
that lady would have no objections to inviting
her nephew to dinner after her &#8220;companion&#8217;s&#8221;
departure.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to stay?&#8221; demanded Philip
suspiciously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m here a week on trial,&#8221; said Patty, demurely.
&#8220;Your aunt needn&#8217;t keep me longer
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
if I don&#8217;t suit her. And I know I won&#8217;t suit
her if she thinks I receive notes from her
nephew.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I see! You&#8217;re here a week on trial, and
if I am chummy with you Aunty Van won&#8217;t
keep you! Oh, yes! Why, of course! To be
sure! Well, Miss Fairfield, I make this sacrifice
for your benefit. I will keep away from
here during your trial week. Then, in return,
you promise to use your influence to get me an
invitation to dine here next Friday.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; returned Patty. &#8220;But do you need
an invitation to a house where you seem to feel
so much at home?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only when you&#8217;re in it,&#8221; declared the young
man, frankly. &#8220;I think Aunty Van fears I
mean to kidnap you. I don&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Patty, flashing a
smile at him. &#8220;I think we could be good
friends, and I hope we shall be. But not until
after next Friday.&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>AN INVITATION DECLINED</h3>
</div>

<p>Philip Van Reypen went away, and
his aunt never knew that he had been to
her house on that occasion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad that boy has sense enough to keep
away when I tell him to,&#8221; she remarked at
luncheon, and Patty hastily took a sip of water
to hide her uncontrollable smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he seems to obey you,&#8221; she said, by
way of being agreeable.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He does. He&#8217;s a good boy, but too impressionable.
He&#8217;s captivated by every girl he
meets, so I warn you again, Miss Fairfield, not
to notice his pretended interest in you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty tossed her head a little haughtily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not be alarmed, Mrs. Van Reypen,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;I have no interest whatever in your
nephew.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was a little annoyed at the absurd speeches
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
of the old lady, and determined to put a stop to
them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should hope not,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;A person
in your position should not aspire to association
with young gentlemen like my nephew.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty was really angry at this, but her common
sense came to her aid. If she elected to
play the part of a dependent, she must accept
the consequences. But she allowed herself a
pointed rejoinder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps not,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Yet I suppose a
companion of Mrs. Van Reypen&#8217;s would meet
only the best people.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That, of course. But you cannot meet them
as an equal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; agreed Patty, meekly. Then to herself
she said: &#8220;Only a week of this! Only six
days now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>That afternoon they went to the dressmaker&#8217;s.
</p>
<p>Patty put on a smart tailored costume, and
almost regretted that she had left her white
furs at home. But she and Nan had agreed
that they were too elaborate for her use as a
companion, so she wore a small neckpiece and
muff of chinchilla. But it suited well her dark-blue
cloth suit and plain but chic black velvet
hat.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></p>
<p>The dressmaker, an ultra-fashionable modiste,
looked at Patty with interest, recognising in her
costume the work of adept hands.
</p>
<p>Moreover, Patty&#8217;s praise and criticism of Mrs.
Van Reypen&#8217;s new gowns showed her to be a
young woman of taste and knowledge in such
matters.
</p>
<p>Both the modiste and her aristocratic patron
were a little puzzled at Patty&#8217;s attitude, which,
though modest and deferential, was yet sure
and true in its judgments and opinions.
</p>
<p>At last, when Mrs. Van Reypen was undergoing
some tedious fitting, Patty had an
inspiration.
</p>
<p>&#8220;May I be excused long enough to telephone?&#8221;
she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; said Mrs. Van Reypen, who was
in high good humour, because of her new finery.
&#8220;Take all the time you like.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty had noticed a telephone booth in the
hall, and, shutting herself in it, she called up
Nan.
</p>
<p>By good fortune Nan was at home, and
answered at once.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; began Patty, giggling, &#8220;I&#8217;ve so much
to tell you, and it&#8217;s all so funny, I can&#8217;t say a
word. We&#8217;re at the dressmaker&#8217;s now, and I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
took this chance to call you up, because I won&#8217;t
be overheard. Oh, Nan, it&#8217;s great fun!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me the principal facts, Patty. And stop
giggling. Is she kind to you? Is she patronising?
Have you a pleasant room? Do you
want to come home? Are you happy there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Nan, wait a minute, for goodness&#8217; sake!
Yes, she&#8217;s patronising&mdash;she won&#8217;t let me speak
to her grand nephew. Oh&mdash;I don&#8217;t mean her
grand nephew! I mean her grand, gorgeous,
extraordinary nephew. But I don&#8217;t care; I&#8217;ve
no desire to speak to him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Does he live there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; and never mind about him, anyway.
How are you all? Is father well? Oh, Nan,
it seems as if I&#8217;d been away from home a year!
And what do you think? I have to dance for
her to amuse her!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty! Not really? Well, you can do that
all right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure I can! Oh, she&#8217;s a peach! Don&#8217;t reprove
my slang, Nan; I have to be so precise
when I&#8217;m on duty. Well, I must say good-by
now. I&#8217;ll write you a long letter as soon as
I get a chance. To-night we&#8217;re going to see
Mlle. Thingamajig dance, and to-morrow night,
to the opera. So you see I&#8217;m not dull.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Patty, I wish you&#8217;d drop it all and come
home! I don&#8217;t like it, and Fred doesn&#8217;t
either.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tra-la-la! &#8217;Twill all be over soon! Only
six days more. Expect me home next Thursday
afternoon. Love to all. Good-by. Patty!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty hung up the receiver, for she knew if
she talked any longer she&#8217;d get homesick. The
sound of Nan&#8217;s familiar voice made her long
for her home and her people. But Patty was
plucky, and, also, she was doggedly determined
to succeed this time.
</p>
<p>So she went back to Mrs. Van Reypen with
a placid countenance, and sat for an hour or
more complimenting and admiring the costumes
in process of construction.
</p>
<p>Somehow the afternoon dragged itself away,
and the evening, at the theatre, passed pleasantly
enough.
</p>
<p>But the succeeding days went slowly.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Van Reypen was difficult to please. She
was fretty, irritable, inconsequent, and unjust.
</p>
<p>What suited her one day displeased her highly
the next.
</p>
<p>So long as Patty praised, complimented, and
flattered her all went fairly well.
</p>
<p>But if Patty inadvertently disagreed with her,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
or expressed a contrary opinion, there was a
scene.
</p>
<p>And again, if Patty seemed especially meek
and mild Mrs. Van Reypen would say:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t sit there and assent to everything I
say! Do have some mind of your own! Express
an honest opinion, even though it may
differ from mine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then, if Patty did this, it would bring down
vials of wrath on her inoffensive head. Often
she was at her wits&#8217; end to know what to say.
But her sense of humour never deserted her,
and if she said something, feeling sure she was
going to get sorely berated for saying it, she
was able to smile inwardly when the scathing
retort was uttered.
</p>
<p>Sunday was an especially hard day. It was
stormy, so they could not go out.
</p>
<p>So Mrs. Van Reypen bade Patty read sermons
to her.
</p>
<p>When Patty did so she either fell asleep and
then, waking suddenly, declared that Patty had
been skipping, or else she argued contrary to
the doctrines expressed in the sermons and expected
Patty to combat her arguments.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m tired of hearing you read,&#8221; she said, at
last. &#8220;You do read abominably. First you go
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
along in staccato jerks, then you drone in a
monotone. Philip is a fine reader. I love to
hear Philip read. I wish he&#8217;d come in to-day.
I wonder why he doesn&#8217;t? Probably because
you&#8217;re here. He must have taken a violent dislike
to you, Miss Fairfield.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think so?&#8221; said Patty, almost choking
with suppressed laughter at this version of
Philip&#8217;s attitude toward her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m sure he did. For usually he likes
my companions&mdash;especially if they&#8217;re pretty.
And you&#8217;re pretty, Miss Fairfield. Not the
type I admire myself,&mdash;I prefer brunettes,&mdash;but
still you are pretty in your own way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Patty, meekly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re especially pretty when you dance.
I wish you could dance for me now; but, of
course, I wouldn&#8217;t let you dance on Sunday.
That&#8217;s the worst of Sundays. There&#8217;s so little
one can do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I sing hymns to you?&#8221; inquired Patty,
gently, for she really felt sorry for the discontented
old lady.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, if you like,&#8221; was the not very gracious
rejoinder, and, without accompaniment, Patty
sang the old, well-known hymns in her true,
sweet voice.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span></p>
<p>The twilight was falling, and, as Patty&#8217;s soothing
music continued, Mrs. Van Reypen fell
asleep in her chair.
</p>
<p>Exhausted by a really difficult day Patty also
dropped into a doze, and the two slept peacefully
in their chairs in front of the dying embers
of the wood fire.
</p>
<p>It was thus that Philip Van Reypen found
them as he came softly in at five o&#8217;clock.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be excused,&#8221; he said, to himself,
&#8220;if I ever saw anything to beat that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>His gaze had wandered from his sleeping aunt
to Patty, now sound asleep in a big armchair.
</p>
<p>The crimson velvet made a perfect background
for her golden curls, a bit tumbled by
her afternoon exertions at being entertaining.
</p>
<p>Her posture was one of graceful relaxation,
and pretty Patty had never looked prettier than
she did then, asleep in the faint firelight.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By Jove!&#8221; exclaimed the young man, but
not aloud, &#8220;if that isn&#8217;t the prettiest sight ever.
I believe there&#8217;s a tradition that one may kiss
a lady whom one finds asleep in her chair, but
I won&#8217;t. She&#8217;s a dear little girl, and she shan&#8217;t
be teased.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then Mr. Philip Van Reypen deliberately,
and noiselessly, lifted another large armchair
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
and, carefully disposing his own goodly proportioned
frame within it, proceeded to fall
asleep himself&mdash;or if not really asleep, he gave
an exceedingly good imitation of it.
</p>
<p>Patty woke first. As she slowly opened her
eyes she saw Philip dimly through the now
rapidly gathering dusk.
</p>
<p>Quick as a flash she took in the situation, and
shut her eyes again, though not until Philip
had seen her from beneath his own quivering
lids.
</p>
<p>After a time she peeped again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why play hide-and-seek?&#8221; he whispered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What about your promise?&#8221; she returned,
also under her breath.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Had to come. Aunty telephoned for me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then Mrs. Van Reypen awoke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s here?&#8221; she cried out. &#8220;Oh, Philip,
you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She heartily kissed her nephew, and then rang
for lights and tea.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Fairfield,&#8221; she said, not untimidly, but
with decision, &#8220;you are weary and I&#8217;m not surprised
at it. Go to your room and rest until
dinner time! I will send your tea to you
there.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mrs. Van Reypen,&#8221; said Patty, demurely,
and, with a slight impersonal bow to
Philip, she left the room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I say! Aunty Van!&#8221; exclaimed the
young man, as Patty disappeared, &#8220;don&#8217;t send
her away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Be quiet, Philip,&#8221; said his aunt. &#8220;You
know you don&#8217;t like her, and she needs a
rest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t like her!&#8221; echoed Philip. &#8220;Does a
cat like cream? Aunty Van, what&#8217;s the matter
with you, anyway? Who is she?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s my companion,&#8221; was the stern response,
&#8220;my hired companion, and I do not
wish you to treat her as an equal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Equal! She&#8217;s superior to anything I&#8217;ve ever
seen yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you rogue! You say that, or its equivalent,
about every girl you meet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh! Nonsense! But I say, aunty, she&#8217;ll
come down to dinner, won&#8217;t she?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;I suppose so. But mind now, Philip,
you&#8217;re not to talk to her as if she were of your
own class.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No&#8217;m; I won&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Reassured by the knowledge that he should see
her again, Philip was most affable and agreeable,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
and chatted with his aunt in a happy frame
of mind.
</p>
<p>Patty, exiled to her own room, decided to write
to Nan.
</p>
<p>She filled several sheets with accounts of her
doings at Mrs. Van Reypen&#8217;s, and gloated over
the fact that there were now but four days of
her week left.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall win this time,&#8221; she wrote, &#8220;and,
though life here is not a bed of roses, yet it
is not so very bad, and when the week is over
I shall look back at it with lots of funny
thoughts. Oh, Nan, prepare a fatted calf for
Thursday night, for I shall come home a veritable
Prodigal Son! Of course, I don&#8217;t mean this
literally; we have lovely things to eat here, but
it&#8217;s &#8216;hame, hame, fain wad I be.&#8217; I won&#8217;t write
again, I&#8217;ll probably get no chance, but send
Miller for me at four o&#8217;clock on Thursday
afternoon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>After writing the letter Patty felt less homesick.
It seemed, somehow, to bring Thursday
nearer, to write about it. She began to
dress for dinner, and, in a spirit of mischief,
she took pains to make a most fetching
toilette.
</p>
<p>Her frock was of white mousseline de soie
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
that twinkled into foolish little ruffles all round
the hem.
</p>
<p>More tiny frills gambolled around the low-cut
circular neck and nestled against Patty&#8217;s soft,
round arms.
</p>
<p>Her curly hair was parted, and massed low
at the back of her neck, and behind one ear she
tucked a half-blown pink rosebud.
</p>
<p>The long, dreamy day had roused in Patty a
contrary wilfulness, and she was quite ready for
fun if any came her way.
</p>
<p>At dinner Mrs. Van Reypen monopolised the
conversation. She talked mostly to Philip,
but occasionally addressed a remark to Patty.
She was exceedingly polite to her, but made
her feel that her share of the conversation
must be formal and conventional. Then she
would chatter to her nephew about matters
unknown to Patty, and then perhaps again
throw an observation about the weather at her
&#8220;companion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty accepted all this willingly enough, but
Philip didn&#8217;t.
</p>
<p>He couldn&#8217;t keep his eyes off Patty, who was
looking her very prettiest, and whose own
eyes, when she raised them, were full of
smiles.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></p>
<p>But in vain he endeavoured to make her talk
to him.
</p>
<p>Patty remembered Mrs. Van Reypen&#8217;s injunctions,
and, though her bewitching personality
made such effort useless, she tried to be absolutely
and uninterestingly silent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunty Van,&#8221; said Philip, at last, giving up
his attempts to make Patty converse, &#8220;let&#8217;s have
a little theatre party to-morrow night. Shall
us? I&#8217;ll get a box, and if you and Miss Fairfield
will go, I&#8217;ll be delighted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go, with pleasure,&#8221; replied his aunt, &#8220;but
Miss Fairfield will be obliged to decline. She
has been out late too often since she has been
here, and she needs rest. So invite the Delafields
instead, and that will make a pleasant
quartette.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For an instant Patty was furiously angry at
this summary disposal of herself, but when she
saw Philip&#8217;s face she almost screamed with
laughter.
</p>
<p>Crestfallen faintly expressed his appearance.
He was crushed, and looked absolutely stunned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How he is under his aunt&#8217;s thumb!&#8221; thought
Patty, secretly disgusted at his lack of self-assertion,
but she suddenly changed her mind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Aunty Van,&#8221; she heard him saying,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
in a cool, determined voice, &#8220;but I prefer
to choose my own guests. I do not care to ask
the Delafields&mdash;unless you especially desire it.
I am sorry Miss Fairfield cannot go, but I trust
you will honour me with your presence.&#8221;
Philip had scored.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Van Reypen well knew if she went alone
with her nephew, under such conditions, he
would be sulky all the evening. Nor could she
insist on having the Delafields asked after the
way he had put it.
</p>
<p>She then nobly endeavoured to undo the mischief
she had wrought.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Philip, I don&#8217;t care especially about the
Delafields. And if Miss Fairfield thinks it will
not tire her too much I shall be glad to have
her accept your kindness.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His kindness, indeed! Patty felt like saying,
&#8220;Do you know I am Patricia Fairfield, and it
is I who confer an honour when I accept an
invitation?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t exactly pride, but Patty had been
brought up in an atmosphere of somewhat old-fashioned
chivalry, and it jarred on her sense
of the fitness of things to have Philip&#8217;s invitation
to her referred to as a &#8220;kindness.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So she decided to take a stand herself.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I thank you for your <i>kindness</i>, Mr. Van Reypen,&#8221;
she said, with just the slightest emphasis
on <i>kindness</i>, &#8220;but I cannot accept it. I quite
agree with Mrs. Van Reypen that I need
rest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The speech was absurd on the face of it, for
Patty&#8217;s rosy, dimpled cheeks and sparkling eyes
betokened no weariness or lassitude.
</p>
<p>But Mrs. Van Reypen accepted this evidence
of the girl&#8217;s obedience to her wishes, and said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right, Miss Fairfield, and my
nephew will excuse you from his party.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Philip sent her a reproachful glance, and Patty
dropped her eyes again, wishing dinner was
over.
</p>
<p>At last the ladies left the table, and Philip
rose and held aside the portière while his aunt
passed through.
</p>
<p>As Patty followed, he detained her a moment,
and whispered:
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is cruel of you to punish me for my aunt&#8217;s
unkindness.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help it,&#8221; said Patty, and as her
troubled eyes met his angry ones they both
smiled, and peace was restored.
</p>
<p>&#8220;After Friday,&#8221; whispered Patty, as she went
through the doorway.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span></p>
<p>&#8220;After Friday,&#8221; he repeated, puzzled by her
words, but reassured by her smiles.
</p>
<p>And then Mrs. Van Reypen sent Patty to her
room for the night, and when Philip came to
the drawing-room he found he was destined to
be entertained by his aunt alone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Patty, to her own reflection
in her mirror, &#8220;a companion can&#8217;t expect to
sit with &#8216;the quality,&#8217; but it does seem a shame
to dress up pretty like this and then be sent to
bed at nine o&#8217;clock! Never mind, only three
evenings more in this house, and then victory
for Patty Fairfield!&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>THE ROAD TO SUCCESS</h3>
</div>

<p>Patty adhered to her resolution not to
go to the theatre on Monday night, but
when she saw Mrs. Van Reypen and
Philip start off she secretly regretted her
decision.
</p>
<p>She loved fun and gaiety, and it suddenly
seemed to her that she had been foolishly sensitive
about Mrs. Van Reypen&#8217;s attitude toward
her.
</p>
<p>However, it couldn&#8217;t be helped now, so she
prepared to spend the evening reading in the
library.
</p>
<p>She would have liked to hold a long telephone
conversation with Nan and her father, but she
thought she had better not, for there were so
many house servants on duty that a maid or a
footman would be likely to overhear her.
</p>
<p>She played the piano and sang a little, then
she wandered about the large and lonely rooms.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
Patty was a sociable creature, and had never
before spent an evening entirely alone, unless
when engaged in some important and engrossing
work.
</p>
<p>But after a while the telephone rang, and
when the parlour-maid told her the call was for
her she flew to the instrument with glad
anticipation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; she cried, and &#8220;Hello!&#8221; returned
a familiar voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Ken! of all people. How <i>did</i> you know
I was here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I found it out! How are you? May
I come to see you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed! I&#8217;m a companion. I&#8217;m not
expected to have callers. But I&#8217;m glad to talk
to you this way. I&#8217;m alone in the house, except
for the servants.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Alone! Then let me come up for a few
minutes, and chat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; Mrs. Van Reypen wouldn&#8217;t like it, I&#8217;m
sure. But, oh, Ken, I&#8217;m making good this time!
On Thursday the week will be up, and I&#8217;ll get
my fifteen dollars. Isn&#8217;t that gay?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a plucky girl, Patty, and I congratulate
you. Is it very horrid?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it isn&#8217;t exactly horrid, but I&#8217;m fearfully
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
homesick. But it&#8217;s only three more days now,
and won&#8217;t I be glad to get home!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And we&#8217;ll be glad to have you. The goldfish
are dull and moping, and we all want our
Patty back again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s nice of you. But, Ken, how did you
know where to find me? I made Nan and
father promise not to tell.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I may as well confess: I basely worried
it out of Miller. I asked him where he
took you to last Thursday afternoon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! I meant to tell him not to tell, but I
forgot it. Well, it doesn&#8217;t matter much, as you
chanced to strike a time when I&#8217;m alone. But
don&#8217;t call me up again. I&#8217;m not supposed to
have any social acquaintances.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good for you, Patty! If you play the game,
play it well. I expect you&#8217;re a prim, demure
companion as ever was.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I am. And if the lady didn&#8217;t
have such a fishy nephew I&#8217;d get along
beautifully.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oho! A nephew, eh? And he&#8217;s smitten
with your charms, as they always are in
novels.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Patty, in a simpering tone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes! I can&#8217;t see you, but I know you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
have your finger in your mouth and your eyes
shyly cast down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re <i>so</i> clever!&#8221; murmured Patty, giggling.
&#8220;But now you may go, Ken, for I don&#8217;t
want to talk to you any more. Come round
Thursday night, can&#8217;t you, and welcome me
home?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh, you&#8217;re late with your invitation. Mrs.
Fairfield has already invited me to dinner that
very evening.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good! Well, good-by for now. I have
reasons for wishing to discontinue this conversation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I have reasons for wishing to keep on.
If you&#8217;re tired talking, sing to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Thou art so near and yet so far,&#8217;&#8221;
hummed Patty, in her clear, sweet voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, don&#8217;t sing. Central will think you&#8217;re a
concert. Well, good-by till Thursday.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by,&#8221; said Patty, and hung up the
receiver.
</p>
<p>But she felt much more cheerful at having
talked with Kenneth, and the coming days
seemed easier to bear.
</p>
<p>They proved, however, to be quite hard
enough.
</p>
<p>The very next day, when Patty went down to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
the breakfast room, determined to do her best
to please Mrs. Van Reypen, she found that lady
suffering from an attack of neuralgia.
</p>
<p>Though not a serious one, it seriously affected
her temper, and she was cross and irritable
to a degree that Patty had never seen
equalled.
</p>
<p>She snapped at the servants; she was short of
speech to Patty; she found fault with everything,
from the coffee to the cat.
</p>
<p>After breakfast they went to the sunny, pleasant
morning room, and Patty made up her mind
to a hard day.
</p>
<p>Then she had an inspiration. She remembered
how susceptible Mrs. Van Reypen was to flattery,
and she determined to see if large doses
of it wouldn&#8217;t cure her ill temper.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How lovely your hair is,&#8221; said Patty, apropos
of nothing. &#8220;I do so admire white hair,
and yours is so abundant and of such fine
texture.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As she had hoped, Mrs. Van Reypen smiled
in a pleased way.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Miss Fairfield, you should have seen
it when I was a girl. It was phenomenal. But
of late years it has come out sadly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You still have quantities,&#8221; said Patty, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
very truthfully, too, &#8220;and its silvery whiteness
is so becoming to your complexion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think so?&#8221; said Mrs. Van Reypen,
smiling most amiably. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s much
wiser not to colour one&#8217;s hair, for now-a-days
so many people turn gray quite young.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they do. I&#8217;ve several friends with gray
hair who are very young women indeed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed the other, comfortably, &#8220;white
hair no longer indicates that a woman is advanced
in years. You speak very sensibly, Miss
Fairfield.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty smiled to herself at the success of her
little ruse, &#8220;And, after all,&#8221; she thought, &#8220;I&#8217;m
telling her only the truth. Her hair is lovely,
and she may as well know I appreciate it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you ever tried,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;wearing
it in a coronet braid?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I&#8217;ve thought I should like to, but I&#8217;ve
worn puffs so long I don&#8217;t know how to change.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me do it for you,&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;I&#8217;m
sure I could dress it to please you. At any rate,
it would do no harm to try.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So up they went to Mrs. Van Reypen&#8217;s dressing
room, and Patty spent most of the morning
trying and discussing different modes of
hair-dressing.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></p>
<p>Mrs. Van Reypen&#8217;s maid was present, and she
admired Patty&#8217;s cleverness and deftness at the
work.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have a touch,&#8221; declared Mrs. Van Reypen,
as she surveyed herself by the aid of a
hand-mirror. &#8220;You&#8217;re positively Frenchy in
your touch. Where did you learn it? Have
you ever been a lady&#8217;s-maid?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Patty, suppressing her smiles, &#8220;I
never have. But I&#8217;ve spent a winter in Paris,
and I picked up some French notions, I
suppose.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You certainly did. You are clever with your
fingers, I can see that. Can you trim hats?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I can,&#8221; said Patty, smiling to herself
at the recollection of her experiences with Mme.
Villard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph! You seem pretty sure of yourself.
I wish you&#8217;d trim one for me, then; but I don&#8217;t
want you to spoil the materials.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do my best,&#8221; said Patty, meekly, and
Mrs. Van Reypen instructed her maid to bring
out some boxes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; she said, taking up a finished hat, &#8220;is
one my milliner has just sent home, and I think
it a fright. Now here&#8217;s a last year&#8217;s hat, but
the plumes are lovely. If you could untrim this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
first one, and transfer these plumes, and then
add these roses&mdash;what do you think?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Secretly Patty thought the new hat was lovely
just as it was, but her plan that morning was to
humour the testy old lady and, if possible, make
her forget her neuralgic pains.
</p>
<p>So she took the hats, and sat down to rip and
retrim them.
</p>
<p>Meantime, Mrs. Van Reypen instructed her
maid to practise dressing her hair in the fashion
Patty had done it.
</p>
<p>But the maid was not very deft in the art, and
soon Patty heard Mrs. Van Reypen shrilly
exclaiming:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stupid! Not that way! You have neither
taste nor brains! Place the braid higher. No,
not so high as that! Oh, you <i>are</i> an idiot!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Deeming it best not to interfere, Patty went
on with her work.
</p>
<p>Also, Mrs. Van Reypen went on with her
scolding, which so upset the long-suffering maid
that she fell to weeping and thereby roused her
mistress to still greater ire.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Crying, are you!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;If you
had such a painful neck and shoulder as I have
you well might cry. But to cry about nothing!
Bah! Leave me, and do not return until you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
can be pleasant. Miss Fairfield, will you please
finish putting up my hair?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty laid down her work, and did as she was
requested. She was sorry for the maid and incensed
at Mrs. Van Reypen&#8217;s injustice and disagreeableness,
but she felt intuitively that it was
the best plan to be, herself, kind and affable.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I&#8217;ll do it!&#8221; she said, pleasantly.
&#8220;Your hat is almost finished, and we can try
it on with your hair done this way. I&#8217;m sure
the effect will be charming.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mollified at this, Mrs. Van Reypen smiled
benignly on her companion, and also smiled
admiringly at her own mirrored reflection.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Patty, as, a little later, she
brought the completed hat for inspection, &#8220;I
will try this on and see how it looks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Van Reypen seated herself again in front
of her dressing mirror, and with gestures
worthy of Madame Villard herself, Patty
placed the hat on her head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s most becoming,&#8221; began Patty, when
Mrs. Van Reypen interrupted her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Becoming?&#8221; she cried. &#8220;It is dreadful!
It is <i>fearful</i>. It makes me look like an old
woman!&#8221;
</p>
<p>With an angry jerk she snatched the offending
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
hat from her head and threw it across the
room.
</p>
<p>Patty was about to give a horrified exclamation
when the funny side of it struck her, and
she burst into laughter. Mrs. Van Reypen was
really an elderly lady, and her angry surprise
at being made to look like one seemed very
funny to Patty.
</p>
<p>But in a moment she understood the case.
</p>
<p>She had thought the hat in question of too
youthful a type for Mrs. Van Reypen, and in
retrimming it had made it more subdued and
of a quieter, more elderly fashion.
</p>
<p>But she now realised that she had been expected
to make it of even gayer effect than it
had shown at first. This was an easy matter,
and picking up the hat she straightened it out,
and hastily catching up a bunch of pink roses
and a glittering buckle, she said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it isn&#8217;t finished yet; these other trimmings
I want to put in place while the hat is
on your head.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Mrs. Van Reypen, only half-convinced.
</p>
<p>But she sat down again, and Patty replaced the
hat, and then adjusted the roses and the buckle,
giving the whole a dainty, pretty effect, which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
though over-youthful, perhaps, was really very
becoming to the fine-looking old lady.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Charming!&#8221; she exclaimed, letting her recent
display of bad temper go without apology.
&#8220;I felt sure you could do it. This afternoon we
will go out to the shops and buy some materials,
and you shall make me another hat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They did so, and, though it meant an afternoon
of rather strenuous shopping, Patty didn&#8217;t
mind it much, for Mrs. Van Reypen couldn&#8217;t
fly into a rage in the presence of the salespeople.
</p>
<p>And so the days dragged by. Patty had hard
work to keep her own temper when her employer
was unreasonably cross and snappish,
but she stuck to her plan of flattering her, and
it worked well more often than not.
</p>
<p>Nor was she insincere. There were so many
admirable qualities and traits of Mrs. Van Reypen
that she really admired, it was easy enough
to tell her so, and invariably the lady was
pleased.
</p>
<p>But she often broke out into foolish, unjustifiable
rages, and then Patty had to wait meekly
until they passed over.
</p>
<p>But when, at last, Wednesday evening had
gone by, and she went to her room, knowing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
it was the last night she should spend under that
roof, she was glad indeed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Another week of this would give me nervous
prostration!&#8221; she said to herself. &#8220;But
to-morrow my week is up, and that means Success!
I have really and truly succeeded in earning
my own living for a week, and I&#8217;m glad and
proud of it. I knew I should succeed, but I
confess I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d score so many failures
first. But perhaps that makes my success all
the sweeter. Anyway, I&#8217;m jolly glad I&#8217;m going
home to-morrow. Wow! but I&#8217;m homesick.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then she tumbled into bed, and soon forgot
her homesickness in a sound, dreamless sleep.
</p>
<p>Patty had been uncertain whether to tell Mrs.
Van Reypen the true story of her week of companionship
or not; but on Thursday morning
she decided she would do so.
</p>
<p>And, as it chanced, after breakfast Mrs. Van
Reypen herself opened the way for Patty&#8217;s
confidences.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Fairfield,&#8221; she said, as they sat down
in the library, &#8220;you know our trial week is up
to-day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mrs. Van Reypen, and you remember
that either of us has the privilege of terminating
our engagement to-day.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I do remember, and, though I fear you will
be greatly disappointed, I must tell you that I
have decided that I cannot keep you as my
companion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As Patty afterward told Nan, she was &#8220;struck
all of a heap.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She had been wondering how she should persuade
Mrs. Van Reypen to let her go, and now
the lady was voluntarily dismissing her! It
was so sudden and so unexpected that Patty
showed her surprise by her look of blank
amazement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew you&#8217;d feel dreadful about it,&#8221; went
on Mrs. Van Reypen, with real regret in her
tone, &#8220;but I cannot help it. You are not, by
nature, fitted for the position. You are&mdash;I
don&#8217;t exactly know how to express it, but you
are not of a subservient disposition.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Patty, &#8220;I&#8217;m not. But I have
tried to do as you wanted me to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I could see that. But you are too
high-strung to be successful in a position of this
kind. You should be more deferential in spirit
as well as in manner. Do I make myself
clear?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You do, Mrs. Van Reypen,&#8221; said Patty,
smiling; &#8220;so clear that I am going to tell you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
the truth about this whole business. I&#8217;m not
really obliged to earn my own living. I have a
happy home and loving parents. My father,
though not a millionaire, is wealthy and generous
enough to supply all my wants, and the
reason I took this position with you is a special
and peculiar one, which I will tell you about
if you care to hear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You sly puss!&#8221; cried Mrs. Van Reypen,
with a smile that indicated relief rather than
dismay at Patty&#8217;s revelation. &#8220;Then you&#8217;ve
been only masquerading as a companion?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Patty, smiling back at her, &#8220;that&#8217;s
about the size of it.&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>HOME AGAIN</h3>
</div>

<p>After Patty had told Mrs. Van Reypen
the whole story of her efforts to earn
her living for a week, and why she had
undertaken such a thing, she found herself occupying
a changed place in that lady&#8217;s regard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was fine of you, perfectly fine!&#8221; Mrs. Van
Reypen declared, &#8220;to sacrifice yourself, your
tastes, and your time for a noble end like
that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t praise me more than I deserve,&#8221; said
Patty, smiling. &#8220;I did begin the game with
a charitable motive, but I thought it was going
to be easy. When I found it difficult I fear I
kept on rather from stubbornness than anything
else.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t call it stubbornness, Miss Fairfield;
I call it commendable perseverance, and I&#8217;m
glad you&#8217;ve told me your story. Of course, I
wouldn&#8217;t have wished you to tell me at first,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
for had I known it I wouldn&#8217;t have taken you.
But you have honestly tried to do your work
well, and you succeeded as well as you could.
But, as I told you, you are not made for that
sort of thing. Your disposition is not that of
a subordinate, and I am glad you do not really
have to be one. You have earned your salary
this week, however, and I gladly pay you the
fifteen dollars we agreed upon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Van Reypen handed Patty the money,
and as the girl took it she said, earnestly: &#8220;As
you may well believe, Mrs. Van Reypen, this
money means more to me than any I have ever
before received in my life. It is the first I have
ever earned by my own exertions, and, unless
I meet with reverses of fortune, it will probably
be the last. But, more than that, it proves my
success in the somewhat doubtful enterprise I
undertook and it assures a chance, at least, of
another girl&#8217;s success in life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am greatly interested in your young art
student,&#8221; went on Mrs. Van Reypen. &#8220;Can
you not bring her to see me when she comes,
and perhaps I may be of use to her in some
friendly way?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How good you are!&#8221; exclaimed Patty.
</p>
<p>She was surprised at the complete change of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
demeanour in Mrs. Van Reypen, though of
course she realised it was due to the fact that
she was now looked upon as a social equal and
not a dependent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is all so uncertain yet,&#8221; Patty went on.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know exactly how we are to persuade
the girl to come North at all. She is of a proud
and sensitive nature that would reject anything
like charity.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you will doubtless arrange the matter
somehow, and when you do, remember that I
shall be glad to help in any way I can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you very much,&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;It
may be that you can indeed help us. And now,
Mrs. Van Reypen, mayn&#8217;t I read to you, or
something? You know my week isn&#8217;t up until
this afternoon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not literally, perhaps; but for the few hours
that are left of your stay with me I shall look
upon you as a guest, not a &#8216;companion.&#8217; And
as I always like to entertain my guests pleasantly,
I shall, if you agree, telephone for Philip
to come to luncheon with us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The old lady&#8217;s eyes twinkled at the idea of
Philip&#8217;s surprise at the changed conditions,
and Patty smiled, too, as she expressed her
assent.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span></p>
<p>When Philip arrived he was, of course,
amazed at his aunt&#8217;s demeanour. She not only
seemed to approve of Miss Fairfield, but treated
her as an honoured guest and seemed more than
willing that Philip should chat socially with her.
Soon she explained to him the cause of her sudden
change of attitude.
</p>
<p>Philip laughed heartily. &#8220;I suspected something
of the sort,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Miss Fairfield
didn&#8217;t strike me as being of the &#8216;thankful and
willin&#8217; to please&#8217; variety. She tried her best,
but her deference was forced and her meekness
assumed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But she did it well,&#8221; said Mrs. Van Reypen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; very well. Still I like her better in
her natural rôle of society lady.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, not that!&#8221; protested Patty. &#8220;I&#8217;m not
really a society lady. In fact, I&#8217;m not &#8216;out&#8217;
yet. I&#8217;m just a New York girl.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you born here?&#8221; asked Mrs. Van
Reypen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Patty, laughing; &#8220;I was born
South, and I&#8217;ve only lived North about five
years. One of those I&#8217;ve spent abroad, and one
or two outside of New York. So when I say
I&#8217;m a New York girl I only mean that I live
here now.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mayn&#8217;t I come to see you?&#8221; asked Philip.
&#8220;Where do you live?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I live on Seventy-second Street,&#8221; said Patty,
&#8220;and you may come to tea some Wednesday
if you like. That&#8217;s my mother&#8217;s &#8216;day,&#8217; and I
often receive with her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see you&#8217;re well brought up,&#8221; said Mrs. Van
Reypen, nodding her head approvingly. &#8220;I&#8217;m
a bit surprised though that your mother allowed
you to undertake this escapade.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you see, she&#8217;s my stepmother&mdash;she&#8217;s
only six years older than I am. So she hasn&#8217;t
much jurisdiction over me; and as for my father&mdash;well,
really, I ran away!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The luncheon was a merry feast, for Mrs. Van
Reypen made a gala affair of it, and, though
there were but the three at table, there was
extra elaboration of viands and decorations.
</p>
<p>Philip Van Reypen was in his gayest humour,
and his aunt was beaming and affable.
</p>
<p>So they were really sorry when it was time for
Patty to say good-by.
</p>
<p>At four o&#8217;clock Miller came for her, and when
Patty saw the familiar motor-car her homesickness
came back like a big wave, and with farewells,
speedy though cordial, she gladly let
Philip hand her into the limousine.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Home, Miller!&#8221; she said, with a glad ring
in her voice, and then, with a final bow and
smile to the Van Reypens, she started off.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Discharged!&#8221; she thought, smiling to herself.
&#8220;Didn&#8217;t give satisfaction! Too high-falutin
to be a companion! Huh, Patty Fairfield,
I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re much of a success!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was talking to the reflection of herself in
the small mirror opposite her face, but the
happy and smiling countenance she saw there
didn&#8217;t tally with her remarks. &#8220;Oh, well,&#8221;
she thought, &#8220;I only agreed to earn my living
for a week, and I&#8217;ve done it&mdash;I&#8217;ve done
it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She opened her purse to make sure the precious
fifteen dollars was still there, and she looked
at it proudly. She had more money than that
in another part of her purse, but no bills could
ever look so valuable as the ten and five Mrs.
Van Reypen had paid her.
</p>
<p>At last she reached home, and as she ran up
the steps the door flew open, and she saw Nan
and her father, with smiling faces, awaiting her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, people!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Oh, you <i>dear</i>
people!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She flung herself indiscriminately into their
open arms, embracing both at once.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span></p>
<p>Then she produced her precious bills, and,
waving them aloft, cried:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve succeeded! I&#8217;ve really succeeded! Behold
the proofs of Patty&#8217;s success!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good for you, girlie!&#8221; cried her father.
&#8220;You have succeeded, indeed! But don&#8217;t you
ever dare cut up such a prank again!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, don&#8217;t!&#8221; implored Nan. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had the
most awful time the whole week! Every night
Fred vowed he was going to bring you home,
and I had to beg him not to. I wanted you
to win,&mdash;and I felt sure you would this time,&mdash;but
you owe it to me. For if I hadn&#8217;t worked
so hard to prevent it your father would have
gone after you long ago&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good for you, Nan!&#8221; cried Patty. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
been a trump! You&#8217;ve helped me through
every time, in all my failures and in my one
success. Oh, I&#8217;ve so much to tell you of my
experiences! They were awfully funny.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll keep till later,&#8221; said Nan. &#8220;You
must run and dress now; Ken and the Farringtons
are coming to dinner to help us celebrate
your success.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So Patty went dancing away to her own room,
singing gaily in her delight at being once more
at home.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you booful room!&#8221; she cried, aloud,
as she reached her own door. &#8220;All full of
pretty <i>homey</i> things, and fresh flowers, and
my own dear books and pictures, and&mdash;and
everything!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She threw herself on the couch and kissed the
very sofa cushions in her joy at seeing them
again.
</p>
<p>Then she made her toilette, and put on one
of her prettiest and most becoming frocks.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, daddy, dear,&#8221; she cried, meeting him
in the hall on her way down, &#8220;it has done me
lots of good to be homeless for a week! I
appreciate my own dear home so much more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you were away from it for a year.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s different! Travelling or visiting
is one thing, but working for your living is quite
another! Oh, <i>don&#8217;t</i> lose all your fortune, will
you, father? I don&#8217;t want to have to go out
into the cold world and earn my own support.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it isn&#8217;t as easy as you thought it was?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear no! It isn&#8217;t easy at all! It&#8217;s
dreadful! Every way I tried was worse than
every other. But I succeeded, didn&#8217;t I?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you did. You fulfilled your part of the
contract, and when the time comes I&#8217;m ready
to fulfil mine.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to see Mr. Hepworth about
that,&#8221; replied Patty.
</p>
<p>Then Kenneth and the two Farringtons came,
and the wonderful fifteen dollars had to be
shown to them, and they had to be told all
about Patty&#8217;s harrowing experiences.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never again express an opinion on matters
I don&#8217;t know anything about,&#8221; declared
Patty. &#8220;Just think! I only said I thought it
would be <i>easy</i> to earn fifteen dollars a week, and
look what I&#8217;ve been through in consequence!
But I&#8217;ve won at last!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Plucky Patty!&#8221; said Kenneth, appreciatively.
&#8220;I knew you&#8217;d win if it took all
summer!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But it wasn&#8217;t a complete triumph,&#8221; confessed
Patty, &#8220;for she wouldn&#8217;t have kept me another
week. She practically discharged me to-day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fired?&#8221; cried Roger, in glee. &#8220;Fired from
your last place! Wanted, a situation! Oh,
Patty, you do beat all!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then Patty told them of her own surprise
when Mrs. Van Reypen told her she would not
do as a permanent companion, and they all
laughed heartily at the funny description she
gave of the scene.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said her father, &#8220;you fulfilled
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
the conditions. A week was the stipulated time,
and nothing was said about your outlook for a
second week.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The next night Mr. Hepworth came, and the
whole story was told over again to him. He
didn&#8217;t take it so lightly as the young people
had done, but looked at Patty sympathetically,
and said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor little girl, you did have a hard time,
didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I did,&#8221; replied Patty, &#8220;though nobody
else seems to realise that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The kindness in Mr. Hepworth&#8217;s glance
seemed to bring back to her all those long,
lonely, weary hours, and she felt grateful
that one, at least, understood what she had
suffered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was worth spending that awful week to
achieve your purpose,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;but I well
know how hard it was for a home-loving girl
like you. And I fancy it was none too easy to
find yourself at the beck and call of another
woman.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it wasn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Patty, surprised at his
insight. &#8220;How did you know that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you are an independent young person,
and accustomed to ordering your own times
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
and seasons. So I&#8217;m sure to be obedient to
another&#8217;s orders was somewhat galling.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was <i>so</i>!&#8221; and Patty&#8217;s emphatic nod of her
head proved to Mr. Hepworth that he had
struck a true chord.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; said Mr. Fairfield, &#8220;when can
I make my offer good? How can we induce
the rising young artist to come to the metropolis
to seek fame and fortune?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be difficult,&#8221; said Mr. Hepworth, &#8220;as
she is not only proud and sensitive, but very
shy. I think if Mrs. Fairfield would write one
of her kind and tactful letters that Miss Farley
would be persuaded by it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t I write a kind and tactful letter?&#8221;
asked Patty. &#8220;It&#8217;s my picnic.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t write a tactful letter to save
your life,&#8221; said Mr. Hepworth, looking at her
with a grave smile.
</p>
<p>Patty returned his look, and she wondered to
herself why she wasn&#8217;t angry with him for making
such a speech.
</p>
<p>But, as she well knew, when Mr. Hepworth
made a seemingly rude speech it wasn&#8217;t really
rude, but it was usually true.
</p>
<p>She knew herself she couldn&#8217;t write such a letter
as this occasion required, and she knew that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
Nan could. So she smiled meekly at Mr. Hepworth,
and said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I couldn&#8217;t. But Nan can be tactful to
beat the band!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Patty!&#8221; said her father. &#8220;Did you
talk like that to Mrs. Van Reypen? No wonder
she discharged you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t, daddy; truly I didn&#8217;t. I never
used a word of slang that whole week, except
one day when I talked to Nan over the
telephone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Soon you&#8217;ll be old enough to begin to think
it&#8217;s time to stop using it at all,&#8221; observed Mr.
Hepworth, and again Patty took his mild reproof
in good part.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll write,&#8221; said Nan. &#8220;Shall I ask
Miss Farley to come to visit us? Won&#8217;t she
think that rather queer?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t put it just that way,&#8221; advised Mr.
Hepworth. &#8220;Say that you, as a friend of mine,
are interested in her career. And say that if
she will come to New York for a week and
stay with you, you think you can help her make
arrangements for a course in the Art School.
Your own tact will dress up the idea so as to
make it palatable to her pride.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t it be fun?&#8221; exclaimed Patty. &#8220;It
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
will be almost like adopting a sister. What
is she like, Mr. Hepworth? Like me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She is about as unlike you as it is possible
for a girl to be. She is very slender, dark, and
timid, with the air of a frightened animal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll scare her to death,&#8221; declared Patty, with
conviction. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure I shall! I don&#8217;t mean
on purpose, but I&#8217;m so&mdash;so <i>sudden</i>, you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you are,&#8221; agreed Mr. Hepworth, as he
joined in the general laughter. &#8220;But that
&#8216;suddenness&#8217; of yours is a quality that I wish
Miss Farley possessed. It is really a sort of
brave impulse and quick determination that
makes you dash into danger or enterprise of
any kind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And win!&#8221; added Patty saucily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and win&mdash;after a time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh well,&#8221; she replied, tossing her head,
&#8220;Mr. Bruce&#8217;s spider made seven attempts before
he succeeded. So I think my record&#8217;s
pretty fair.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so, too,&#8221; said Mr. Hepworth, heartily.
&#8220;And I congratulate you on your plucky
perseverance and your indomitable will. You
put up a brave fight, and you won. I know how
you suffered under that petty tyranny, and your
success in such circumstances was a triumph!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Patty, greatly pleased at
this sincere praise from one whom she so greatly
respected. &#8220;It would have been harder still
if I hadn&#8217;t had a good sense of humour. Lots
of times when I wanted to cry I laughed
instead.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah for you, Patty girl!&#8221; cried her father.
&#8220;I&#8217;d rather you&#8217;d have a good sense of
humour than a talent for spatter-work!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you back number!&#8221; exclaimed Patty.
&#8220;They don&#8217;t do spatter-work now, daddy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, china painting&mdash;or whatever the present
fad is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Mr. Hepworth seemed not to place so
high a value on a sense of humour, for he said,
gravely:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I congratulate you on your steadfastness of
purpose, which is one of the finest traits of your
character.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Patty, with dancing eyes.
&#8220;You give it a nice name. But it is a family
trait with us Fairfields, and has usually been
called &#8216;stubbornness.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; supplemented her father, &#8220;I&#8217;m sure
that&#8217;s just as good a name.&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>CHRISTINE COMES</h3>
</div>

<p>With her usual tact and cleverness,
Nan managed the whole matter successfully.
She wrote to the friends
of Mr. Hepworth in the South who were interested
in Miss Farley, and they persuaded the
girl to go North for a week and see if she could
see her way clear to staying there.
</p>
<p>As it turned out, Miss Farley had some acquaintances
in New York, and when their invitation
was added to that of Mrs. Fairfield,
she decided to make the trip.
</p>
<p>Patty and Nan made ready for her with great
care and kindness. A guest room was specially
prepared for her use, and Patty adorned it with
some of her own pet pictures, a few good casts,
and certain bits of bric-à-brac that she thought
would appeal to an &#8220;art student.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If Mr. Hepworth hadn&#8217;t said the girl had
real talent I&#8217;d be hopeless of the whole thing,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
said Nan, &#8220;for I do think the most futile sort
of young woman is the one who dabbles in Art,
with a big A.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Christine Farley isn&#8217;t that sort,&#8221; declared
Patty. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe she wears her
hair tumbling down and a Byron collar with a
big, black ribbon bow at her throat. I used to
see that sort copying in the art galleries in Paris,
and they <i>are</i> hopeless. But I imagine Miss
Farley is a tidy little thing and her genius is too
real for those near-art effects.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, I&#8217;ll put this photograph of the
Hermes in here in place of this fiddle-de-dee
Art Calendar. She&#8217;ll like it better.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course she will. And I&#8217;m going to put a
pretty kimono and slippers in the wardrobe.
Probably she won&#8217;t have pretty ones, and I
know she&#8217;ll love &#8217;em.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you owned a white elephant, Patty, you&#8217;d
get a kimono for it, wouldn&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Course I would. I love kimonos&mdash;pretty
ones. And besides, it would fit an elephant better
than a Directoire gown would.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty! What a goose you are! There, now
the room looks lovely! The flowers are just
right&mdash;not too many and just in the right
places.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Patty; &#8220;if she doesn&#8217;t like this
room I wash my hands of her. But she will.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And she did. When the small, shy Southern
girl arrived that afternoon, and Patty herself
showed her up to her room, she seemed to respond
at once to the warm cosiness of the
place.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just such a room as I&#8217;ve often imagined,
but I&#8217;ve never seen,&#8221; she said, smiling round
upon the dainty, attractive appointments.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You dear!&#8221; cried Patty, throwing her arms
round her guest and kissing her.
</p>
<p>When she had first met Christine downstairs
she was embarrassed herself at the Southern
girl&#8217;s painful shyness.
</p>
<p>When Miss Farley had tried to speak words
of greeting a lump came into her throat and
she couldn&#8217;t speak at all.
</p>
<p>To put her more at her ease Patty had led her
at once upstairs, and now the presence of only
warm-hearted Patty and the view of the welcoming
room made her forget her embarrassment
and seem more like her natural self.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot thank you,&#8221; she began. &#8220;I am a
bit bewildered by it all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you are,&#8221; said Patty, cheerily.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t bother about thanks. And don&#8217;t feel
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
shy. Let&#8217;s pretend we&#8217;ve known each other for
years&mdash;long enough to use first names. May
I take your hat off, Christine?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tears sprang to Christine Farley&#8217;s eyes at this
whole-souled welcome, and she said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You make me ashamed of my stupid shyness.
Really I&#8217;ll try to overcome it&mdash;Patty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And soon the two girls were chatting cosily and
veritably as if they had been acquainted a long
time.
</p>
<p>Presently Nan came in. &#8220;If you prefer, Miss
Farley,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you needn&#8217;t come down to
dinner to-night. I&#8217;ll have a tray sent up here.
I know you&#8217;re tired with your journey.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thank you, Mrs. Fairfield; I&#8217;m not
tired&mdash;and I think I&#8217;ll go down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl would have greatly preferred to accept
the offer of dining in her own room, but
she felt it her duty to conquer the absurd
timidity which made her dread facing strangers
at dinner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be glad if you will,&#8221; said Nan, simply.
&#8220;Mr. Fairfield will like to welcome you, and
Mr. Hepworth will be the only other guest.
You are not afraid of him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; said Christine, her face lighting up
at thought of her kind friend. &#8220;He has
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
been so good to me. His criticisms of my work
helped me more than any of my teachers&#8217;.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he is an able artist and a man of true
kindness and worth,&#8221; agreed Nan. &#8220;Very well,
Miss Farley, we dine at seven.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Nan,&#8221; began Patty, smiling, &#8220;that&#8217;s
the wrong tone. We&#8217;re going to make this
girlie feel homelike and comfortable and omit
all formality. We&#8217;re going to call her by her
first name, and we&#8217;re going to treat her as one
of ourselves. Now you just revise that little
speech of &#8216;We dine at seven, Miss Farley.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Nan, quickly catching Patty&#8217;s
idea. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad to revise it. How&#8217;s this?
Dinner&#8217;s at seven, Christine, but you hop into
your clothes and come on down earlier.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a lot better,&#8221; said Patty, approvingly
patting her stepmother&#8217;s shoulder, while Christine
Farley, who was all unaccustomed to this
sort of raillery, looked on in admiration.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve only very plain
clothes. I&#8217;m not at all familiar with the ways
of society, or even of well-to-do people.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, pooh!&#8221; said Patty, emphatically, if not
very elegantly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you bother about that
in this house. Trot out your frocks and I&#8217;ll tell
you what to put on.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span></p>
<p>After some consideration she selected a frock
of that peculiar shade known as &#8220;ashes of
roses.&#8221; It was of soft merino and made very
simply, with long, straight lines.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you like that?&#8221; said Christine, looking
pleased. &#8220;That&#8217;s my newest one, and I designed
it myself. See, I wear this with it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She took from her box a dull silver girdle and
chatelaine of antique, carved silver, and a comb
for her hair of similar style.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lovely!&#8221; cried Patty. &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re an
artist, all right! Dress your hair low&mdash;in a
soft coil; but of course you know how to do
that. I&#8217;ll send Louise to hook you up, and I&#8217;ll
come back for you when I&#8217;m dressed. Good-by
for now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Waving her hand gaily, laughing Patty ran
away to her own room, and Christine sank down
in a big chair to collect her senses.
</p>
<p>It was all so new and strange to her. Brought
up in the plainest circumstances, the warmth
and light and fragrance of this home seemed
to her like fairyland.
</p>
<p>And Nan and Patty, in their gay moods and
their happy self-assuredness, seemed as if of a
different race of beings from herself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ll learn it,&#8221; she thought, with a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
determination which she had rarely felt and scarce
knew she possessed. Her nature was one that
needed a spur or help from another, and then
she was ready to do her part, too.
</p>
<p>But she could not take the initiative. And
now, realising the disinterested kindness of
these good people, her sense of gratitude made
her resolve to meet their kindness with
appreciation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said to herself, as she deftly
dressed her hair in front of the mirror, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
conquer this silly timidity if it kills me! I&#8217;ll
take Patty Fairfield for a model, and I&#8217;ll acquire
that very same ease and grace that she
has.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Christine was imitative by nature, and it
seemed to her now that she could never feel
stupidly embarrassed again.
</p>
<p>But after Patty came to take her downstairs,
and as they neared the drawing-room door, the
foolish shyness all returned, and she was white
and trembling as she crossed the hall.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Brace up,&#8221; whispered Patty, understanding,
&#8220;you&#8217;re looking lovely, Christine. Now be gay
and chattery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Chattery,&#8221; indeed! Her tongue seemed
paralysed, her very neck felt strained and stiff,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
and she stumbled over the rug in her effort to
stop trembling. In her own room, alone with
Patty and Nan, she had overcome this, but now,
in the brilliantly lighted drawing-room and the
presence of other people, the terrible timidity
returned, and Christine made a most unsuccessful
entrance.
</p>
<p>But Mr. Fairfield ignored the girl&#8217;s embarrassment,
and said, cordially but quietly: &#8220;How
do you do, Miss Farley? I am very glad to
welcome you here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His kind handclasp reassured her even more
than his pleasant words, and then Mr. Hepworth
greeted her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You did well to come,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I am glad
to see you in New York at last.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Christine couldn&#8217;t recover herself, and so,
as the kindest thing to do, the rest rather let
her alone and chatted on other subjects.
</p>
<p>Gradually she grew less agitated, and as their
merry chit-chat waxed gay and frivolous, her
determination returned, that she, too, would acquire
this accomplishment.
</p>
<p>Then dinner was announced, and, though outwardly
calm, the Southern girl was inwardly
in great trepidation lest she commit some ignorant
error in etiquette.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span></p>
<p>But she was of gentle birth and breeding, and
innately refined, so she knew intuitively regarding
all points, save perhaps some modern trifles
of conventional usage.
</p>
<p>Nan, who was watching her, though unobserved,
led the conversation around to subjects
in which Christine might be likely to be interested,
and was rewarded at last by seeing the
girl&#8217;s face light up with an enjoyment unmarred
by self-consciousness.
</p>
<p>Gradually she was induced to take some part
in their talk, and once she told an anecdote of
her own experience without seeming aware of
her unusual surroundings.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll do,&#8221; thought Patty. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t ignorance
or inexperience that&#8217;s the greatest trouble;
it&#8217;s just ingrowing shyness, and she&#8217;s got to get
over it; I&#8217;ll see that she does, too!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Hepworth read Patty&#8217;s unspoken thoughts
in her eyes and nodded approval.
</p>
<p>Patty nodded back with a dimpling smile, and
Christine, seeing it, vowed afresh to gain the
ability to do that sort of thing herself.
</p>
<p>For all Southern girls have a touch of the
coquette in their natures, but poor Christine&#8217;s
was nearly choked out by the weeds of timidity
and self-consciousness.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span></p>
<p>After dinner it was easier. They went to the
cosy library, and the atmosphere seemed more
informal.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hepworth brought up the subject of Miss
Farley&#8217;s work, and she was persuaded to fetch
some sketches to show them.
</p>
<p>Though not able to appreciate the fine points
of promise as Mr. Hepworth did, they were all
greatly pleased with them, and Mr. Fairfield
declared them wonderful.
</p>
<p>In her own field Christine was fearless and
quite sure of herself.
</p>
<p>She talked intelligently about pictures, and
many pleasant plans were made for taking her
to see several collections then on exhibition, as
well as to the Metropolitan and other art
galleries.
</p>
<p>Nan and Patty exchanged pleased glances as
Christine talked eagerly, and with shining eyes
and pink cheeks, about her own aims and
ambitions.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hepworth was responsive, and advised
her on some minor points, but the great question
of her art education in New York was not
touched upon that first evening.
</p>
<p>Christine had grown almost gay in her chatter,
when Kenneth was announced. Like a sensitive
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
plant at a human touch, she lost all her poise,
her face turned white, and her lips quivered as
she braced herself for the ordeal of meeting a
stranger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; thought Patty, almost disgusted at
this foolishness, &#8220;she is the limit!&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Nan appreciated more truly the real state
of the case, and knew that Christine had borne
just about all she could, and that owing to
physical fatigue and mental strain her nerves
were just about ready to give way.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you do, Kenneth?&#8221; said Nan,
airily. &#8220;Too bad you didn&#8217;t come earlier. I
am just taking our little guest away from this
admiring crowd, who are tiring her all out with
their admiration. She may just say &#8216;howdy&#8217;
to you, and then I&#8217;m going to carry her off.
Miss Farley, this is our Kenneth&mdash;Mr.
Harper.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Stimulated by Nan&#8217;s support and by the sudden
chance for release, Christine managed to
acknowledge the introduction prettily enough,
and then gladly let Nan take her upstairs
to bed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I&#8217;m so horrid,&#8221; said the girl, as
Nan helped her take off her gown.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; replied Nan, cheerily. &#8220;You
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
weren&#8217;t horrid a bit. You looked lovely and
behaved like a little lady. Your nerves are
overwrought, and I don&#8217;t wonder. Just tumble
into bed, dearie, and forget everything in all
the world, except that you&#8217;re among warm
friends.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nan had most comforting ways, and soon
Christine forgot her troubles in a happy sleep.
</p>
<p>Meantime, Kenneth was admiring her sketches.
&#8220;Whew!&#8221; he said, &#8220;she&#8217;s a genius all right.
But such a shy little mouse never can succeed
as an artist.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, she will!&#8221; declared Patty. &#8220;Her shyness
will wear off in New York. I&#8217;m going to
eradicate it from her make-up somehow, and
then we&#8217;re going to make a famous artist
of her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can be a great help to her, Patty,&#8221; said
Mr. Hepworth. &#8220;If any one makes Christine
think she can do things, she can do them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I see that already,&#8221; agreed Patty, &#8220;and
I&#8217;m going to be the one to make her think she
can do them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; teased Kenneth. &#8220;You think you
can make anybody think they think anything!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; said Patty, complacently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t teach Miss Farley to talk slang,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
said Mr. Fairfield, laughing, &#8220;for it would be
too incongruous with that Madonna face of
hers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She is like a Madonna, isn&#8217;t she?&#8221; said
Patty, thoughtfully. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been trying to think
what her face reminded me of.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, she is,&#8221; said Mr. Hepworth, &#8220;and as
I feel pretty sure you can&#8217;t teach her to use
slang, why don&#8217;t you take this occasion to discontinue
the use of it yourself?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t do it,&#8221; returned Patty. &#8220;There are
times in my mad career when nothing expresses
what I want to say so well as a mild bit of slang.
I never say anything very dreadful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you don&#8217;t,&#8221; declared Kenneth,
who loved to take Patty&#8217;s part against Mr.
Hepworth. &#8220;Why, you wouldn&#8217;t be &#8216;Our
Patty&#8217; if you used only dictionary English. All
the slang Miss Farley gets from you will do her
good rather than harm. She needs it in her
make-up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I agree with the spirit of that, if not the
letter,&#8221; said Mr. Hepworth, kindly; and Patty
said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, she needs to be jollied; and, you take it
from me, she&#8217;s going to get jollied!&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>A SATISFACTORY CONCLUSION</h3>
</div>

<p>As Nan had surmised, Christine was worn
out by her day of fatigue and excitement,
and the next morning found her
possessed of better mental poise and a more
placid manner.
</p>
<p>And as more days went by the girl improved
greatly in demeanour and bearing, and lost, to
a great degree, her look of startled fear and
painful self-consciousness. Of course this was
not accomplished completely, or all at once, but
helped by the kind gentleness of Nan and affectionate
chaffing of Patty, Christine grew
more accustomed to the pleasant social atmosphere
into which she had been so suddenly
thrown.
</p>
<p>They visited picture galleries and went to the
shops, and went driving and motoring, and
though Christine could not be persuaded to go
to afternoon teas, or to formal luncheons, yet
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
she enjoyed the pleasures she had and grew
every day more at her ease in society.
</p>
<p>Her own determination helped her greatly.
She purposed to yet become as unaffected and
un-self-conscious as Patty, and, though she knew
she could never acquire Patty&#8217;s inborn gaiety
of spirit, she resolved to come as near to it as
she could with her naturally quiet disposition.
</p>
<p>The two girls became fast friends, and, after
a few days, Patty ventured to broach the subject
of Christine&#8217;s career.
</p>
<p>To her surprise, Christine was quite ready to
talk about it, and asked Patty&#8217;s advice as to
ways and means.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve already learned,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that I have
some talent and that I need the instruction and
experience that I can get here and cannot get
at home. When I once make up my mind to
a thing I spare no effort to achieve it, and now
I&#8217;m determined to get an art education by some
manner or means!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hooray for you!&#8221; cried Patty, for Christine&#8217;s
cheeks glowed and her eyes sparkled with
the force of her speech. &#8220;That&#8217;s the way to
talk! Christine, you do me proud! Now, go
on; what have you in mind? Tell your Aunt
Patty all about it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span></p>
<p>Christine smiled at Patty&#8217;s funny little ways,
but she went on bravely:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to stay in New York for a year, at
least. I&#8217;m afraid of it&mdash;desperately so. The
very sound of the traffic scares me out of my
wits. But I&#8217;m going to conquer that, and I&#8217;m
going to conquer my shyness and timidity and
all the foolish things that stand in my way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the ticket!&#8221; cried Patty, clapping
her hands. &#8220;Good old Christine! Go in and
win!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a bit, Patty. That&#8217;s all very well so
far as determination and will are concerned.
And I can do it. My will is strong, and I know
I&#8217;m started now on the right track. But&mdash;there
are many hard facts to face. There&#8217;s a sordid
side to the question that can&#8217;t be solved by will-power
and determination. Mr. Hepworth
thinks I can get a scholarship practically without
cost; but, in addition to that, I have to pay
my board, you know, and I have very little
money. My dear old father can send me a
small allowance, but we are a large family, and
he is not rich. So I want to know if you think
I could earn enough by some work outside my
classes to pay my board&mdash;say, about fifteen dollars
a week. Do you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span></p>
<p>Patty couldn&#8217;t help it. This question from
Christine was too much!
</p>
<p>She was sitting on a couch, and she put her
head down into a big, soft pillow, and shook
with laughter. Did <i>she</i> think a girl could earn
fifteen dollars a week? <i>Did</i> she, indeed? With
a strange sound between a gurgle and a choke,
she ran out of the room.
</p>
<p>Not for worlds would she have Christine
think she was laughing at her, so in a moment
she had straightened her grinning face, smothered
her giggles, and returned, saying:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me, please; I had a sudden choking
spell. What were you saying?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You poor dear! Mayn&#8217;t I get you a glass
of water?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thanks; I&#8217;m all right now. As to your
question&mdash;no, Christine, I do <i>not</i> think you
could earn fifteen dollars a week! No, nor fifteen
cents a week, while you&#8217;re occupied with your
lessons.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Christine looked aghast. &#8220;Oh, Patty!&#8221; she
said. &#8220;Then what am I to do? I thought
you&#8217;d say, yes, I could earn that sum easily.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again Patty wanted to laugh. A month ago
she would have said that very thing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Christine,&#8221; she said, gently, &#8220;listen to me.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
We Fairfields and Mr. Hepworth all take an
interest in you and in your career. We all feel
sure you will yet be a great artist. Of course,
our belief is founded on Mr. Hepworth&#8217;s assertions,
but we know he is capable of judging.
Now you must have that year of study, and by
that time Mr. Hepworth feels sure you can
earn quite a lot of money by illustrating, and
whatever he thinks goes!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Christine, as Patty paused, uncertain
how to proceed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you see,&#8221; went on Patty, suddenly deciding
that the plain, outspoken facts were
best, &#8220;father has offered to pay your board for
a year at some nice, pleasant boarding-house,
and&mdash;&mdash;Mercy! <i>What&#8217;s</i> the matter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>For Christine had turned first a blazing, fiery
red, and then as white as chalk, and seemed
about to tumble off her chair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Brace up there!&#8221; cried Patty, shaking her
by the shoulder. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you faint or do anything
silly! I take it all back. Father wouldn&#8217;t
do such a thing!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You misunderstand!&#8221; said Christine, smiling
faintly through now rapidly falling tears.
&#8220;I almost fainted from sheer gladness.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! I thought you were angry and offended
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
and insulted and mad as hops, and everything
like that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; cried the other. &#8220;Why, Patty,
it isn&#8217;t charity; it&#8217;s great, big, splendid kindness,
and it&#8217;s just a loan, you understand. I can pay
it back in a couple of years after I once begin
to earn money. Patty, you don&#8217;t know how
sure I am of my own ability now that I understand
my limitations. I can&#8217;t explain it, but I
see success ahead as surely as I see the blue
sky out of that window!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Christine gazed out of the window with rapt
eyes, as if she saw visions of the fame and glory
that were yet to be her portion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You duck!&#8221; cried Patty, embracing her.
&#8220;You&#8217;re just splendiferous! That&#8217;s the loveliest
way you could have taken father&#8217;s offer.
He is great, big, splendid kindness personified,
and I&#8217;m so glad you see it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>That evening Mr. Fairfield ratified Patty&#8217;s
statements and definitely offered to pay Christine&#8217;s
board bills for a year.
</p>
<p>To Patty&#8217;s surprise, Christine showed no shyness
or agitation as she answered him.
</p>
<p>Only Nan understood that the girl&#8217;s gratitude
was too real and too deep for any troublesome
self-consciousness to disturb it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Fairfield,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I accept your offer
with unspeakable thankfulness. It means
my whole career, and I assure you I shall reach
my goal. Of course, it is a financial loan, but
after a year I shall be in a position to begin to
pay it back, and it shall be promptly paid. Do
not think I have unfounded faith in my success.
I know what I already possess, and what more
I need, and though my progress to fame may be
slow, and take many long years, yet after a
year&#8217;s tuition I shall be able to command a comfortable
income in return for my work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Christine&#8217;s eyes shone with earnestness and
steadfast purpose, and her face seemed to be
fairly transfigured. Hers was no idle boasting.
It was clear to be seen she spoke from a positive
knowledge of herself, and indeed she only corroborated
what Mr. Hepworth had said of her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Put it that way if you like,&#8221; said Mr. Fairfield,
kindly; &#8220;we need not talk now about repayment.
Just go ahead and find a cosy, pleasant
abiding-place, and then, ho, for brushes and
mahl-stick! And hurrah for our artist!&#8221;
</p>
<p>So genial were his words and manner that
Christine caught his spirit of vivacity, and
responded:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah for the Fairfields!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span></p>
<p>So it was all settled, and Mr. Hepworth was
more than delighted when he learned all
about it.
</p>
<p>Patty gave a little afternoon tea for Christine
the last day of her stay, and though Christine
would have greatly preferred not to be present,
she yielded to Patty&#8217;s entreaties and did her best
to overcome her shyness and be a satisfactory
&#8220;guest of honour.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a beauty, isn&#8217;t she?&#8221; said Roger to
Patty, as they stood looking at Christine while
the tea was in progress.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Patty, &#8220;when she is talking to her
own sort of people. See, those are really big
artists, and she isn&#8217;t a bit afraid or embarrassed.
But put some society girls near her
and she crumples all up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll get over it,&#8221; said Roger; &#8220;and I say,
Patty, you did a big thing getting her here.
For of course it&#8217;s all due to you and your plucky
perseverance in that foolish scheme of earning
your living.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh! it wasn&#8217;t foolish since it succeeded,&#8221;
said Patty, airily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, the success isn&#8217;t foolish, but your first
attempts were.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care; it was good experience. I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
learned a lot, and I&#8217;m not sorry for my part
of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not even the part that made you acquainted
with me?&#8221; said a merry voice, and Patty
turned to see Philip Van Reypen holding out a
hand in greeting.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; cried Patty, as she cordially shook
hands with the young man. &#8220;No, <i>especially</i>
not sorry for that part&mdash;for that was the
Success!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be over-confident,&#8221; returned
Philip, gaily, &#8220;but that sounds as if meeting me
were the success!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That wasn&#8217;t what I meant,&#8221; said Patty, smiling
and dimpling, &#8220;but it remains to be seen.
Perhaps we can make that a success also.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do let us try!&#8221; said Philip.
</p>
